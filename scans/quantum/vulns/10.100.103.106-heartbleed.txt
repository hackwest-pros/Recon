[*] Nmap: |   The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptogra
phic software library. It allows for stealing information intended to be protected by SSL/TL
S encryption.

[*] Nmap: |       OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta releases (including 1.0.1f and 1.0.2
-beta1) of OpenSSL are affected by the Heartbleed bug. The bug allows for reading memory of 
systems protected by the vulnerable OpenSSL versions and could allow for disclosure of other
wise encrypted confidential information as well as the encryption keys themselves.
