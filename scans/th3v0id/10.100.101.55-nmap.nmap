| [43110] vsftpd up to 2.0.4 Memory Leak denial of service
| 
| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2011-2189] net/core/net_namespace.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.32 and earlier does not properly handle a high rate of creation and cleanup of network namespaces, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via requests to a daemon that requires a separate namespace per connection, as demonstrated by vsftpd.
| [CVE-2011-0762] The vsf_filename_passes_filter function in ls.c in vsftpd before 2.3.3 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and process slot exhaustion) via crafted glob expressions in STAT commands in multiple FTP sessions, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.
| [CVE-2009-5029] Integer overflow in the __tzfile_read function in glibc before 2.15 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted timezone (TZ) file, as demonstrated using vsftpd.
| [CVE-2008-4969] ltp-network-test 20060918 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on (a) /tmp/vsftpd.conf, (b) /tmp/udp/2/*, (c) /tmp/tcp/2/*, (d) /tmp/udp/3/*, (e) /tmp/tcp/3/*, (f) /tmp/nfs_fsstress.udp.2.log, (g) /tmp/nfs_fsstress.udp.3.log, (h) /tmp/nfs_fsstress.tcp.2.log, (i) /tmp/nfs_fsstress.tcp.3.log, and (j) /tmp/nfs_fsstress.sardata temporary files, related to the (1) ftp_setup_vsftp_conf and (2) nfs_fsstress.sh scripts.
| [CVE-2008-2375] Memory leak in a certain Red Hat deployment of vsftpd before 2.0.5 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3 and 4, when PAM is used, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large number of invalid authentication attempts within the same session, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-5962.
| [CVE-2007-5962] Memory leak in a certain Red Hat patch, applied to vsftpd 2.0.5 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and Fedora 6 through 8, and on Foresight Linux and rPath appliances, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large number of CWD commands, as demonstrated by an attack on a daemon with the deny_file configuration option.
| [CVE-2007-4322] BlockHosts before 2.0.4 does not properly parse (1) sshd and (2) vsftpd log files, which allows remote attackers to add arbitrary deny entries to the /etc/hosts.allow file and cause a denial of service by adding arbitrary IP addresses to a daemon log file, as demonstrated by connecting through ssh with a client protocol version identification containing an IP address string, or connecting through ftp with a username containing an IP address string, different vectors than CVE-2007-2765.

| 
| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2006-0883] OpenSSH on FreeBSD 5.3 and 5.4, when used with OpenPAM, does not properly handle when a forked child process terminates during PAM authentication, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (client connection refusal) by connecting multiple times to the SSH server, waiting for the password prompt, then disconnecting.
| [CVE-2012-0814] The auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 5.7 provides debug messages containing authorized_keys command options, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information by reading these messages, as demonstrated by the shared user account required by Gitolite.  NOTE: this can cross privilege boundaries because a user account may intentionally have no shell or filesystem access, and therefore may have no supported way to read an authorized_keys file in its own home directory.
| [CVE-2011-5000] The ssh_gssapi_parse_ename function in gss-serv.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, when gssapi-with-mic authentication is enabled, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large value in a certain length field.  NOTE: there may be limited scenarios in which this issue is relevant.
| [CVE-2011-0539] The key_certify function in usr.bin/ssh/key.c in OpenSSH 5.6 and 5.7, when generating legacy certificates using the -t command-line option in ssh-keygen, does not initialize the nonce field, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive stack memory contents or make it easier to conduct hash collision attacks.
| [CVE-2010-4755] The (1) remote_glob function in sftp-glob.c and the (2) process_put function in sftp.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, as used in FreeBSD 7.3 and 8.1, NetBSD 5.0.2, OpenBSD 4.7, and other products, allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any pathnames, as demonstrated by glob expressions in SSH_FXP_STAT requests to an sftp daemon, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.
| [CVE-2010-4478] OpenSSH 5.6 and earlier, when J-PAKE is enabled, does not properly validate the public parameters in the J-PAKE protocol, which allows remote attackers to bypass the need for knowledge of the shared secret, and successfully authenticate, by sending crafted values in each round of the protocol, a related issue to CVE-2010-4252.
| [CVE-2009-2904] A certain Red Hat modification to the ChrootDirectory feature in OpenSSH 4.8, as used in sshd in OpenSSH 4.3 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.4 and Fedora 11, allows local users to gain privileges via hard links to setuid programs that use configuration files within the chroot directory, related to requirements for directory ownership.
| [CVE-2008-3844] Certain Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4 and 5 packages for OpenSSH, as signed in August 2008 using a legitimate Red Hat GPG key, contain an externally introduced modification (Trojan Horse) that allows the package authors to have an unknown impact.  NOTE: since the malicious packages were not distributed from any official Red Hat sources, the scope of this issue is restricted to users who may have obtained these packages through unofficial distribution points.  As of 20080827, no unofficial distributions of this software are known.
| [CVE-2008-3259] OpenSSH before 5.1 sets the SO_REUSEADDR socket option when the X11UseLocalhost configuration setting is disabled, which allows local users on some platforms to hijack the X11 forwarding port via a bind to a single IP address, as demonstrated on the HP-UX platform.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2010-2068] mod_proxy_http.c in mod_proxy_http in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.9 through 2.2.15, 2.3.4-alpha, and 2.3.5-alpha on Windows, NetWare, and OS/2, in certain configurations involving proxy worker pools, does not properly detect timeouts, which allows remote attackers to obtain a potentially sensitive response intended for a different client in opportunistic circumstances via a normal HTTP request.
| [CVE-2010-0434] The ap_read_request function in server/protocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.15, when a multithreaded MPM is used, does not properly handle headers in subrequests in certain circumstances involving a parent request that has a body, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted request that triggers access to memory locations associated with an earlier request.
| [CVE-2010-0408] The ap_proxy_ajp_request function in mod_proxy_ajp.c in mod_proxy_ajp in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.15 does not properly handle certain situations in which a client sends no request body, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (backend server outage) via a crafted request, related to use of a 500 error code instead of the appropriate 400 error code.
| [CVE-2007-6750] The Apache HTTP Server 1.x and 2.x allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon outage) via partial HTTP requests, as demonstrated by Slowloris, related to the lack of the mod_reqtimeout module in versions before 2.2.15.
| [CVE-2013-1048] The Debian apache2ctl script in the apache2 package squeeze before 2.2.16-6+squeeze11, wheezy before 2.2.22-13, and sid before 2.2.22-13 for the Apache HTTP Server on Debian GNU/Linux does not properly create the /var/lock/apache2 lock directory, which allows local users to gain privileges via an unspecified symlink attack.
| [CVE-2012-4557] The mod_proxy_ajp module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.12 through 2.2.21 places a worker node into an error state upon detection of a long request-processing time, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (worker consumption) via an expensive request.
| [CVE-2012-0216] The default configuration of the apache2 package in Debian GNU/Linux squeeze before 2.2.16-6+squeeze7, wheezy before 2.2.22-4, and sid before 2.2.22-4, when mod_php or mod_rivet is used, provides example scripts under the doc/ URI, which might allow local users to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, gain privileges, or obtain sensitive information via vectors involving localhost HTTP requests to the Apache HTTP Server.
| [CVE-2012-0021] The log_cookie function in mod_log_config.c in the mod_log_config module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.17 through 2.2.21, when a threaded MPM is used, does not properly handle a %{}C format string, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a cookie that lacks both a name and a value.
| [CVE-2011-5034] Apache Geronimo 2.2.1 and earlier computes hash values for form parameters without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many crafted parameters.  NOTE: this might overlap CVE-2011-4461.
| [CVE-2011-3639] The mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64 and 2.2.x before 2.2.18, when the Revision 1179239 patch is in place, does not properly interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2) ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for configuration of a reverse proxy, which allows remote attackers to send requests to intranet servers by using the HTTP/0.9 protocol with a malformed URI containing an initial @ (at sign) character.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-3368.
| [CVE-2011-3192] The byterange filter in the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.x, 2.0.x through 2.0.64, and 2.2.x through 2.2.19 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a Range header that expresses multiple overlapping ranges, as exploited in the wild in August 2011, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-0086.
| [CVE-2011-2088] XWork 2.2.1 in Apache Struts 2.2.1, and OpenSymphony XWork in OpenSymphony WebWork, allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information about internal Java class paths via vectors involving an s:submit element and a nonexistent method, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1772.3.
| [CVE-2011-1928] The fnmatch implementation in apr_fnmatch.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library 1.4.3 and 1.4.4, and the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.18, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a URI that does not match unspecified types of wildcard patterns, as demonstrated by attacks against mod_autoindex in httpd when a /*/WEB-INF/ configuration pattern is used.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2011-0419.
| [CVE-2011-1176] The configuration merger in itk.c in the Steinar H. Gunderson mpm-itk Multi-Processing Module 2.2.11-01 and 2.2.11-02 for the Apache HTTP Server does not properly handle certain configuration sections that specify NiceValue but not AssignUserID, which might allow remote attackers to gain privileges by leveraging the root uid and root gid of an mpm-itk process.
| [CVE-2011-0419] Stack consumption vulnerability in the fnmatch implementation in apr_fnmatch.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library before 1.4.3 and the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.18, and in fnmatch.c in libc in NetBSD 5.1, OpenBSD 4.8, FreeBSD, Apple Mac OS X 10.6, Oracle Solaris 10, and Android, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via *? sequences in the first argument, as demonstrated by attacks against mod_autoindex in httpd.
| [CVE-2010-1452] The (1) mod_cache and (2) mod_dav modules in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.16 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process crash) via a request that lacks a path.
| [CVE-2010-0425] modules/arch/win32/mod_isapi.c in mod_isapi in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.37 through 2.0.63, 2.2.0 through 2.2.14, and 2.3.x before 2.3.7, when running on Windows, does not ensure that request processing is complete before calling isapi_unload for an ISAPI .dll module, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors related to a crafted request, a reset packet, and "orphaned callback pointers."
| [CVE-2009-3555] The TLS protocol, and the SSL protocol 3.0 and possibly earlier, as used in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0, mod_ssl in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.14 and earlier, OpenSSL before 0.9.8l, GnuTLS 2.8.5 and earlier, Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) 3.12.4 and earlier, multiple Cisco products, and other products, does not properly associate renegotiation handshakes with an existing connection, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert data into HTTPS sessions, and possibly other types of sessions protected by TLS or SSL, by sending an unauthenticated request that is processed retroactively by a server in a post-renegotiation context, related to a "plaintext injection" attack, aka the "Project Mogul" issue.
| [CVE-2009-3094] The ap_proxy_ftp_handler function in modules/proxy/proxy_ftp.c in the mod_proxy_ftp module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.63 and 2.2.13 allows remote FTP servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and child process crash) via a malformed reply to an EPSV command.
| [CVE-2009-2699] The Solaris pollset feature in the Event Port backend in poll/unix/port.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library before 1.3.9, as used in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.14 and other products, does not properly handle errors, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon hang) via unspecified HTTP requests, related to the prefork and event MPMs.
| [CVE-2009-1891] The mod_deflate module in Apache httpd 2.2.11 and earlier compresses large files until completion even after the associated network connection is closed, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption).
| [CVE-2009-1195] The Apache HTTP Server 2.2.11 and earlier 2.2 versions does not properly handle Options=IncludesNOEXEC in the AllowOverride directive, which allows local users to gain privileges by configuring (1) Options Includes, (2) Options +Includes, or (3) Options +IncludesNOEXEC in a .htaccess file, and then inserting an exec element in a .shtml file.
| [CVE-2009-1191] mod_proxy_ajp.c in the mod_proxy_ajp module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.11 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive response data, intended for a client that sent an earlier POST request with no request body, via an HTTP request.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2013-4124] Integer overflow in the read_nttrans_ea_list function in nttrans.c in smbd in Samba 3.x before 3.5.22, 3.6.x before 3.6.17, and 4.x before 4.0.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a malformed packet.
| [CVE-2011-0719] Samba 3.x before 3.3.15, 3.4.x before 3.4.12, and 3.5.x before 3.5.7 does not perform range checks for file descriptors before use of the FD_SET macro, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption, and infinite loop or daemon crash) by opening a large number of files, related to (1) Winbind or (2) smbd.
| [CVE-2013-0214] Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.21, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, and 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users by leveraging knowledge of a password and composing requests that perform SWAT actions.
| [CVE-2013-0213] The Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.21, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, and 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks via a (1) FRAME or (2) IFRAME element.
| [CVE-2012-1182] The RPC code generator in Samba 3.x before 3.4.16, 3.5.x before 3.5.14, and 3.6.x before 3.6.4 does not implement validation of an array length in a manner consistent with validation of array memory allocation, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted RPC call.
| [CVE-2011-2694] Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the chg_passwd function in web/swat.c in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.10 allows remote authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the username parameter to the passwd program (aka the user field to the Change Password page).
| [CVE-2011-2522] Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.10 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) shut down daemons, (2) start daemons, (3) add shares, (4) remove shares, (5) add printers, (6) remove printers, (7) add user accounts, or (8) remove user accounts, as demonstrated by certain start, stop, and restart parameters to the status program.
| [CVE-2004-0186] smbmnt in Samba 2.x and 3.x on Linux 2.6, when installed setuid, allows local users to gain root privileges by mounting a Samba share that contains a setuid root program, whose setuid attributes are not cleared when the share is mounted.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2013-4124] Integer overflow in the read_nttrans_ea_list function in nttrans.c in smbd in Samba 3.x before 3.5.22, 3.6.x before 3.6.17, and 4.x before 4.0.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a malformed packet.
| [CVE-2011-0719] Samba 3.x before 3.3.15, 3.4.x before 3.4.12, and 3.5.x before 3.5.7 does not perform range checks for file descriptors before use of the FD_SET macro, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption, and infinite loop or daemon crash) by opening a large number of files, related to (1) Winbind or (2) smbd.
| [CVE-2013-0214] Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.21, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, and 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users by leveraging knowledge of a password and composing requests that perform SWAT actions.
| [CVE-2013-0213] The Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.21, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, and 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks via a (1) FRAME or (2) IFRAME element.
| [CVE-2012-1182] The RPC code generator in Samba 3.x before 3.4.16, 3.5.x before 3.5.14, and 3.6.x before 3.6.4 does not implement validation of an array length in a manner consistent with validation of array memory allocation, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted RPC call.
| [CVE-2011-2694] Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the chg_passwd function in web/swat.c in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.10 allows remote authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the username parameter to the passwd program (aka the user field to the Change Password page).
| [CVE-2011-2522] Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.10 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) shut down daemons, (2) start daemons, (3) add shares, (4) remove shares, (5) add printers, (6) remove printers, (7) add user accounts, or (8) remove user accounts, as demonstrated by certain start, stop, and restart parameters to the status program.
| [CVE-2004-0186] smbmnt in Samba 2.x and 3.x on Linux 2.6, when installed setuid, allows local users to gain root privileges by mounting a Samba share that contains a setuid root program, whose setuid attributes are not cleared when the share is mounted.
