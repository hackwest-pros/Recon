| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2011-0539] The key_certify function in usr.bin/ssh/key.c in OpenSSH 5.6 and 5.7, when generating legacy certificates using the -t command-line option in ssh-keygen, does not initialize the nonce field, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive stack memory contents or make it easier to conduct hash collision attacks.
| [CVE-2010-4478] OpenSSH 5.6 and earlier, when J-PAKE is enabled, does not properly validate the public parameters in the J-PAKE protocol, which allows remote attackers to bypass the need for knowledge of the shared secret, and successfully authenticate, by sending crafted values in each round of the protocol, a related issue to CVE-2010-4252.
| [CVE-2012-0814] The auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 5.7 provides debug messages containing authorized_keys command options, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information by reading these messages, as demonstrated by the shared user account required by Gitolite.  NOTE: this can cross privilege boundaries because a user account may intentionally have no shell or filesystem access, and therefore may have no supported way to read an authorized_keys file in its own home directory.
| [CVE-2011-5000] The ssh_gssapi_parse_ename function in gss-serv.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, when gssapi-with-mic authentication is enabled, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large value in a certain length field.  NOTE: there may be limited scenarios in which this issue is relevant.
| [CVE-2010-4755] The (1) remote_glob function in sftp-glob.c and the (2) process_put function in sftp.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, as used in FreeBSD 7.3 and 8.1, NetBSD 5.0.2, OpenBSD 4.7, and other products, allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any pathnames, as demonstrated by glob expressions in SSH_FXP_STAT requests to an sftp daemon, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.
| [CVE-2009-2904] A certain Red Hat modification to the ChrootDirectory feature in OpenSSH 4.8, as used in sshd in OpenSSH 4.3 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.4 and Fedora 11, allows local users to gain privileges via hard links to setuid programs that use configuration files within the chroot directory, related to requirements for directory ownership.
| [CVE-2008-3844] Certain Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4 and 5 packages for OpenSSH, as signed in August 2008 using a legitimate Red Hat GPG key, contain an externally introduced modification (Trojan Horse) that allows the package authors to have an unknown impact.  NOTE: since the malicious packages were not distributed from any official Red Hat sources, the scope of this issue is restricted to users who may have obtained these packages through unofficial distribution points.  As of 20080827, no unofficial distributions of this software are known.
| [CVE-2008-3259] OpenSSH before 5.1 sets the SO_REUSEADDR socket option when the X11UseLocalhost configuration setting is disabled, which allows local users on some platforms to hijack the X11 forwarding port via a bind to a single IP address, as demonstrated on the HP-UX platform.
| [CVE-2006-0883] OpenSSH on FreeBSD 5.3 and 5.4, when used with OpenPAM, does not properly handle when a forked child process terminates during PAM authentication, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (client connection refusal) by connecting multiple times to the SSH server, waiting for the password prompt, then disconnecting.

| [CVE-2007-0061] The DHCP server in EMC VMware Workstation before 5.5.5 Build 56455 and 6.x before 6.0.1 Build 55017, Player before 1.0.5 Build 56455 and Player 2 before 2.0.1 Build 55017, ACE before 1.0.3 Build 54075 and ACE 2 before 2.0.1 Build 55017, and Server before 1.0.4 Build 56528 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malformed packet that triggers "corrupt stack memory."
| [CVE-2006-5990] VMWare VirtualCenter client 2.x before 2.0.1 Patch 1 (Build 33643) and 1.4.x before 1.4.1 Patch 1 (Build 33425), when server certificate verification is enabled, does not verify the server's X.509 certificate when creating an SSL session, which allows remote malicious servers to spoof valid servers via a man-in-the-middle attack.
| [CVE-2006-3589] vmware-config.pl in VMware for Linux, ESX Server 2.x, and Infrastructure 3 does not check the return code from a Perl chmod function call, which might cause an SSL key file to be created with an unsafe umask that allows local users to read or modify the SSL key.
| [CVE-2006-2662] VMware Server before RC1 does not clear user credentials from memory after a console connection is made, which might allow local attackers to gain privileges.
| [CVE-2006-2481] VMware ESX Server 2.0.x before 2.0.2 and 2.x before 2.5.2 patch 4 stores authentication credentials in base 64 encoded format in the vmware.mui.kid and vmware.mui.sid cookies, which allows attackers to gain privileges by obtaining the cookies using attacks such as cross-site scripting (CVE-2005-3619).
| [CVE-2005-4773] The configuration of VMware ESX Server 2.x, 2.0.x, 2.1.x, and 2.5.x allows local users to cause a denial of service (shutdown) via the (1) halt, (2) poweroff, and (3) reboot scripts executed at the service console.
| [CVE-2005-4583] Unspecified vulnerability in the Management Interface in VMware ESX Server 2.x up to 2.5.x before 24 December 2005 allows "remote code execution in the Web browser" via unspecified attack vectors, probably related to cross-site scripting (XSS).
| [CVE-2005-4459] Heap-based buffer overflow in the NAT networking components vmnat.exe and vmnet-natd in VMWare Workstation 5.5, GSX Server 3.2, ACE 1.0.1, and Player 1.0 allows remote authenticated attackers, including guests, to execute arbitrary code via crafted (1) EPRT and (2) PORT FTP commands.
| [CVE-2005-3620] The management interface for VMware ESX Server 2.0.x before 2.0.2 patch 1, 2.1.x before 2.1.3 patch 1, and 2.x before 2.5.3 patch 2 records passwords in cleartext in URLs that are stored in world-readable web server log files, which allows local users to gain privileges.
| [CVE-2005-3618] Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the management interface for VMware ESX Server 2.0.x before 2.0.2 patch 1, 2.1.x before 2.1.3 patch 1, and 2.x before 2.5.3 patch 2 allows allows remote attackers to perform unauthorized actions as the administrator via URLs, as demonstrated using the setUsr operation to change a password.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged with CVE-2005-3619 to automatically perform the attacks.
| [CVE-2003-1291] VMware ESX Server 1.5.2 before Patch 4 allows local users to execute arbitrary programs as root via certain modified VMware ESX Server environment variables.
| [CVE-2003-0631] VMware GSX Server 2.5.1 build 4968 and earlier, and Workstation 4.0 and earlier, allows local users to gain root privileges via certain enivronment variables that are used when launching a virtual machine session.
| [CVE-2002-0814] Buffer overflow in VMware Authorization Service for VMware GSX Server 2.0.0 build-2050 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a long GLOBAL argument.
