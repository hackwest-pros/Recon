| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2010-4755] The (1) remote_glob function in sftp-glob.c and the (2) process_put function in sftp.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, as used in FreeBSD 7.3 and 8.1, NetBSD 5.0.2, OpenBSD 4.7, and other products, allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any pathnames, as demonstrated by glob expressions in SSH_FXP_STAT requests to an sftp daemon, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.
| [CVE-1999-0661] A system is running a version of software that was replaced with a Trojan Horse at one of its distribution points, such as (1) TCP Wrappers 7.6, (2) util-linux 2.9g, (3) wuarchive ftpd (wuftpd) 2.2 and 2.1f, (4) IRC client (ircII) ircII 2.2.9, (5) OpenSSH 3.4p1, or (6) Sendmail 8.12.6.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2013-2852] Format string vulnerability in the b43_request_firmware function in drivers/net/wireless/b43/main.c in the Broadcom B43 wireless driver in the Linux kernel through 3.9.4 allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging root access and including format string specifiers in an fwpostfix modprobe parameter, leading to improper construction of an error message.
| [CVE-2011-1720] The SMTP server in Postfix before 2.5.13, 2.6.x before 2.6.10, 2.7.x before 2.7.4, and 2.8.x before 2.8.3, when certain Cyrus SASL authentication methods are enabled, does not create a new server handle after client authentication fails, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption and daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via an invalid AUTH command with one method followed by an AUTH command with a different method.
| [CVE-2011-0411] The STARTTLS implementation in Postfix 2.4.x before 2.4.16, 2.5.x before 2.5.12, 2.6.x before 2.6.9, and 2.7.x before 2.7.3 does not properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted SMTP sessions by sending a cleartext command that is processed after TLS is in place, related to a "plaintext command injection" attack.
| [CVE-2010-0230] SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP3 (SLE10-SP3) and openSUSE 11.2 configures postfix to listen on all network interfaces, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
| [CVE-2009-2939] The postfix.postinst script in the Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu postfix 2.5.5 package grants the postfix user write access to /var/spool/postfix/pid, which might allow local users to conduct symlink attacks that overwrite arbitrary files.
| [CVE-2008-4977] ** DISPUTED **  postfix_groups.pl in Postfix 2.5.2 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the (1) /tmp/postfix_groups.stdout, (2) /tmp/postfix_groups.stderr, and (3) /tmp/postfix_groups.message temporary files.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this vulnerability, stating "This is not a real issue ... users would have to edit a script under /usr/lib to enable it."
| [CVE-2008-3889] Postfix 2.4 before 2.4.9, 2.5 before 2.5.5, and 2.6 before 2.6-20080902, when used with the Linux 2.6 kernel, leaks epoll file descriptors during execution of "non-Postfix" commands, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (application slowdown or exit) via a crafted command, as demonstrated by a command in a .forward file.
| [CVE-2008-3646] The Postfix configuration file in Mac OS X 10.5.5 causes Postfix to be network-accessible when mail is sent from a local command-line tool, which allows remote attackers to send mail to local Mac OS X users.
| [CVE-2008-2937] Postfix 2.5 before 2.5.4 and 2.6 before 2.6-20080814 delivers to a mailbox file even when this file is not owned by the recipient, which allows local users to read e-mail messages by creating a mailbox file corresponding to another user's account name.
| [CVE-2008-2936] Postfix before 2.3.15, 2.4 before 2.4.8, 2.5 before 2.5.4, and 2.6 before 2.6-20080814, when the operating system supports hard links to symlinks, allows local users to append e-mail messages to a file to which a root-owned symlink points, by creating a hard link to this symlink and then sending a message.  NOTE: this can be leveraged to gain privileges if there is a symlink to an init script.
| [CVE-2007-3791] Buffer overflow in the w_read function in sockets.c in Cami Sardinha and Nigel Kukard policyd before 1.81 for Postfix allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via long SMTP commands.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
| [CVE-2006-0213] Kolab Server 2.0.1, 2.0.2 and development versions pre-2.1-20051215 and earlier, when authenticating users via secure SMTP, stores authentication credentials in plaintext in the postfix.log file, which allows local users to gain privileges.
| [CVE-2005-1127] Format string vulnerability in the log function in Net::Server 0.87 and earlier, as used in Postfix Greylisting Policy Server (Postgrey) 1.18 and earlier, and possibly other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via format string specifiers that are not properly handled before being sent to syslog, as demonstrated using sender addresses to Postgrey.
| [CVE-2005-0337] Postfix 2.1.3, when /proc/net/if_inet6 is not available and permit_mx_backup is enabled in smtpd_recipient_restrictions, allows remote attackers to bypass e-mail restrictions and perform mail relaying by sending mail to an IPv6 hostname.
| [CVE-2004-1113] SQL injection vulnerability in SQLgrey Postfix greylisting service before 1.2.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) sender or (2) recipient e-mail addresses.
| [CVE-2004-1088] Postfix server for Apple Mac OS X 10.3.6, when using CRAM-MD5, allows remote attackers to send mail without authentication by replaying authentication information.
| [CVE-2004-0925] Postfix on Mac OS X 10.3.x through 10.3.5, with SMTPD AUTH enabled, does not properly clear the username between authentication attempts, which allows users with the longest username to prevent other valid users from being able to authenticate.
| [CVE-2003-0540] The address parser code in Postfix 1.1.12 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (lock) via (1) a malformed envelope address to a local host that would generate a bounce and contains the ".!" string in the MAIL FROM or Errors-To headers, which causes nqmgr to lock up, or (2) via a valid MAIL FROM with a RCPT TO containing a ".!" string, which causes an instance of the SMTP listener to lock up.
| [CVE-2003-0468] Postfix 1.1.11 and earlier allows remote attackers to use Postfix to conduct "bounce scans" or DDos attacks of other hosts via an email address to the local host containing the target IP address and service name followed by a "!" string, which causes Postfix to attempt to use SMTP to communicate with the target on the associated port.
| [CVE-2001-0894] Vulnerability in Postfix SMTP server before 20010228-pl07, when configured to email the postmaster when SMTP errors cause the session to terminate, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) by generating a large number of SMTP errors, which forces the SMTP session log to grow too large.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2013-2249] mod_session_dbd.c in the mod_session_dbd module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.5 proceeds with save operations for a session without considering the dirty flag and the requirement for a new session ID, which has unspecified impact and remote attack vectors.
| [CVE-2012-4558] Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the balancer_handler function in the manager interface in mod_proxy_balancer.c in the mod_proxy_balancer module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.24-dev and 2.4.x before 2.4.4 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted string.
| [CVE-2012-3502] The proxy functionality in (1) mod_proxy_ajp.c in the mod_proxy_ajp module and (2) mod_proxy_http.c in the mod_proxy_http module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x before 2.4.3 does not properly determine the situations that require closing a back-end connection, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information in opportunistic circumstances by reading a response that was intended for a different client.
| [CVE-2012-3499] Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.24-dev and 2.4.x before 2.4.4 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving hostnames and URIs in the (1) mod_imagemap, (2) mod_info, (3) mod_ldap, (4) mod_proxy_ftp, and (5) mod_status modules.
| [CVE-2012-3451] Apache CXF before 2.4.9, 2.5.x before 2.5.5, and 2.6.x before 2.6.2 allows remote attackers to execute unintended web-service operations by sending a header with a SOAP Action String that is inconsistent with the message body.
| [CVE-2012-2687] Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the make_variant_list function in mod_negotiation.c in the mod_negotiation module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x before 2.4.3, when the MultiViews option is enabled, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted filename that is not properly handled during construction of a variant list.
| [CVE-2012-2379] Apache CXF 2.4.x before 2.4.8, 2.5.x before 2.5.4, and 2.6.x before 2.6.1, when a Supporting Token specifies a child WS-SecurityPolicy 1.1 or 1.2 policy, does not properly ensure that an XML element is signed or encrypted, which has unspecified impact and attack vectors.
| [CVE-2012-2378] Apache CXF 2.4.5 through 2.4.7, 2.5.1 through 2.5.3, and 2.6.x before 2.6.1, does not properly enforce child policies of a WS-SecurityPolicy 1.1 SupportingToken policy on the client side, which allows remote attackers to bypass the (1) AlgorithmSuite, (2) SignedParts, (3) SignedElements, (4) EncryptedParts, and (5) EncryptedElements policies.
| [CVE-2012-0883] envvars (aka envvars-std) in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.2 places a zero-length directory name in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DSO in the current working directory during execution of apachectl.
| [CVE-2011-2516] Off-by-one error in the XML signature feature in Apache XML Security for C++ 1.6.0, as used in Shibboleth before 2.4.3 and possibly other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a signature using a large RSA key, which triggers a buffer overflow.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2011-4318] Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.16, when ssl or starttls is enabled and hostname is used to define the proxy destination, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a valid certificate for a different hostname.
| [CVE-2011-2167] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the chroot configuration setting, which might allow remote authenticated users to conduct directory traversal attacks by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-2166] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the user and group configuration settings, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-1929] lib-mail/message-header-parser.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.17 and 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not properly handle '\0' characters in header names, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash or mailbox corruption) via a crafted e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-4011] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6.5 10H574 does not properly manage memory for user names, which allows remote authenticated users to read the private e-mail of other persons in opportunistic circumstances via standard e-mail clients accessing a user's own mailbox, related to a "memory aliasing issue."
| [CVE-2010-3780] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (master process outage) by simultaneously disconnecting many (1) IMAP or (2) POP3 sessions.
| [CVE-2010-3779] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.beta2 grants the admin permission to the owner of each mailbox in a non-public namespace, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by changing the ACL of a mailbox, as demonstrated by a symlinked shared mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3707] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving more specific entries that occur after less specific entries, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3706] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving the private namespace of a user, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3304] The ACL plugin in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.13 propagates INBOX ACLs to newly created mailboxes in certain configurations, which might allow remote attackers to read mailboxes that have unintended weak ACLs.
| [CVE-2010-0745] Unspecified vulnerability in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via long headers in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-0535] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6 before 10.6.3, when Kerberos is enabled, does not properly enforce the service access control list (SACL) for sending and receiving e-mail, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via unspecified vectors.
| [CVE-2010-0433] The kssl_keytab_is_available function in ssl/kssl.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8n, when Kerberos is enabled but Kerberos configuration files cannot be opened, does not check a certain return value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via SSL cipher negotiation, as demonstrated by a chroot installation of Dovecot or stunnel without Kerberos configuration files inside the chroot.
| [CVE-2009-3897] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.8 sets 0777 permissions during creation of certain directories at installation time, which allows local users to access arbitrary user accounts by replacing the auth socket, related to the parent directories of the base_dir directory, and possibly the base_dir directory itself.
| [CVE-2009-3235] Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Sieve plugin in Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, as derived from Cyrus libsieve, allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted SIEVE script, as demonstrated by forwarding an e-mail message to a large number of recipients, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2632.
| [CVE-2009-2632] Buffer overflow in the SIEVE script component (sieve/script.c), as used in cyrus-imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.13 and 2.3.14, and Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, allows local users to execute arbitrary code and read or modify arbitrary messages via a crafted SIEVE script, related to the incorrect use of the sizeof operator for determining buffer length, combined with an integer signedness error.
| [CVE-2008-5301] Directory traversal vulnerability in the ManageSieve implementation in Dovecot 1.0.15, 1.1, and 1.2 allows remote attackers to read and modify arbitrary .sieve files via a ".." (dot dot) in a script name.
| [CVE-2008-4907] The message parsing feature in Dovecot 1.1.4 and 1.1.5, when using the FETCH ENVELOPE command in the IMAP client, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent crash) via an email with a malformed From address, which triggers an assertion error, aka "invalid message address parsing bug."
| [CVE-2008-4870] dovecot 1.0.7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5, and possibly Fedora, uses world-readable permissions for dovecot.conf, which allows local users to obtain the ssl_key_password parameter value.
| [CVE-2008-4578] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using the "k" right to create unauthorized "parent/child/child" mailboxes.
| [CVE-2008-4577] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 treats negative access rights as if they are positive access rights, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
| [CVE-2008-1218] Argument injection vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0.x before 1.0.13, and 1.1.x before 1.1.rc3, when using blocking passdbs, allows remote attackers to bypass the password check via a password containing TAB characters, which are treated as argument delimiters that enable the skip_password_check field to be specified.
| [CVE-2008-1199] Dovecot before 1.0.11, when configured to use mail_extra_groups to allow Dovecot to create dotlocks in /var/mail, might allow local users to read sensitive mail files for other users, or modify files or directories that are writable by group, via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2007-6598] Dovecot before 1.0.10, with certain configuration options including use of %variables, does not properly maintain the LDAP+auth cache, which might allow remote authenticated users to login as a different user who has the same password.
| [CVE-2007-5794] Race condition in nss_ldap, when used in applications that are linked against the pthread library and fork after a call to nss_ldap, might send user data to the wrong process because of improper handling of the LDAP connection. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for Dovecot with the wrong mailboxes being returned, but other applications might also be affected.
| [CVE-2007-4211] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.0.3 allows remote authenticated users with the insert right to save certain flags via a (1) COPY or (2) APPEND command.
| [CVE-2007-2231] Directory traversal vulnerability in index/mbox/mbox-storage.c in Dovecot before 1.0.rc29, when using the zlib plugin, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary gzipped (.gz) mailboxes (mbox files) via a .. (dot dot) sequence in the mailbox name.
| [CVE-2007-2173] Eval injection vulnerability in (1) courier-imapd.indirect and (2) courier-pop3d.indirect in Courier-IMAP before 4.0.6-r2, and 4.1.x before 4.1.2-r1, on Gentoo Linux allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the XMAILDIR variable, related to the LOGINRUN variable.
| [CVE-2007-0618] Unspecified vulnerability in (1) pop3d, (2) pop3ds, (3) imapd, and (4) imapds in IBM AIX 5.3.0 has unspecified impact and attack vectors, involving an "authentication vulnerability."
| [CVE-2006-5973] Off-by-one buffer overflow in Dovecot 1.0test53 through 1.0.rc14, and possibly other versions, when index files are used and mmap_disable is set to "yes," allows remote authenticated IMAP or POP3 users to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors involving the cache file.
| [CVE-2006-2502] Stack-based buffer overflow in pop3d in Cyrus IMAPD (cyrus-imapd) 2.3.2, when the popsubfolders option is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long USER command.
| [CVE-2006-2414] Directory traversal vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0 beta and 1.0 allows remote attackers to list files and directories under the mbox parent directory and obtain mailbox names via ".." sequences in the (1) LIST or (2) DELETE IMAP command.
| [CVE-2006-0730] Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Dovecot before 1.0beta3 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash or hang) via unspecified vectors involving (1) "potential hangs" in the APPEND command and "potential crashes" in (2) dovecot-auth and (3) imap/pop3-login.  NOTE: vector 2 might be related to a double free vulnerability.
| [CVE-2002-0925] Format string vulnerability in mmsyslog function allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) the USER command to mmpop3d for mmmail 0.0.13 and earlier, (2) the HELO command to mmsmtpd for mmmail 0.0.13 and earlier, or (3) the USER command to mmftpd 0.0.7 and earlier.
| [CVE-2001-0143] vpop3d program in linuxconf 1.23r and earlier allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2000-1197] POP2 or POP3 server (pop3d) in imap-uw IMAP package on FreeBSD and other operating systems creates lock files with predictable names, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (lack of mail access) for other users by creating lock files for other mail boxes.
| [CVE-1999-1445] Vulnerability in imapd and ipop3d in Slackware 3.4 and 3.3 with shadowing enabled, and possibly other operating systems, allows remote attackers to cause a core dump via a short sequence of USER and PASS commands that do not provide valid usernames or passwords.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2013-4124] Integer overflow in the read_nttrans_ea_list function in nttrans.c in smbd in Samba 3.x before 3.5.22, 3.6.x before 3.6.17, and 4.x before 4.0.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a malformed packet.
| [CVE-2011-0719] Samba 3.x before 3.3.15, 3.4.x before 3.4.12, and 3.5.x before 3.5.7 does not perform range checks for file descriptors before use of the FD_SET macro, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption, and infinite loop or daemon crash) by opening a large number of files, related to (1) Winbind or (2) smbd.
| [CVE-2013-0214] Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.21, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, and 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users by leveraging knowledge of a password and composing requests that perform SWAT actions.
| [CVE-2013-0213] The Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.21, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, and 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks via a (1) FRAME or (2) IFRAME element.
| [CVE-2012-1182] The RPC code generator in Samba 3.x before 3.4.16, 3.5.x before 3.5.14, and 3.6.x before 3.6.4 does not implement validation of an array length in a manner consistent with validation of array memory allocation, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted RPC call.
| [CVE-2011-2694] Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the chg_passwd function in web/swat.c in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.10 allows remote authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the username parameter to the passwd program (aka the user field to the Change Password page).
| [CVE-2011-2522] Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.10 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) shut down daemons, (2) start daemons, (3) add shares, (4) remove shares, (5) add printers, (6) remove printers, (7) add user accounts, or (8) remove user accounts, as demonstrated by certain start, stop, and restart parameters to the status program.
| [CVE-2004-0186] smbmnt in Samba 2.x and 3.x on Linux 2.6, when installed setuid, allows local users to gain root privileges by mounting a Samba share that contains a setuid root program, whose setuid attributes are not cleared when the share is mounted.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2009-2632] Buffer overflow in the SIEVE script component (sieve/script.c), as used in cyrus-imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.13 and 2.3.14, and Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, allows local users to execute arbitrary code and read or modify arbitrary messages via a crafted SIEVE script, related to the incorrect use of the sizeof operator for determining buffer length, combined with an integer signedness error.
| [CVE-2011-4318] Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.16, when ssl or starttls is enabled and hostname is used to define the proxy destination, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a valid certificate for a different hostname.
| [CVE-2011-3481] The index_get_ids function in index.c in imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server before 2.4.11, when server-side threading is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a crafted References header in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2011-3372] imap/nntpd.c in the NNTP server (nntpd) for Cyrus IMAPd 2.4.x before 2.4.12 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by sending an AUTHINFO USER command without sending an additional AUTHINFO PASS command.
| [CVE-2011-2167] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the chroot configuration setting, which might allow remote authenticated users to conduct directory traversal attacks by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-2166] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the user and group configuration settings, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-1929] lib-mail/message-header-parser.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.17 and 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not properly handle '\0' characters in header names, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash or mailbox corruption) via a crafted e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-4011] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6.5 10H574 does not properly manage memory for user names, which allows remote authenticated users to read the private e-mail of other persons in opportunistic circumstances via standard e-mail clients accessing a user's own mailbox, related to a "memory aliasing issue."
| [CVE-2010-3780] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (master process outage) by simultaneously disconnecting many (1) IMAP or (2) POP3 sessions.
| [CVE-2010-3779] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.beta2 grants the admin permission to the owner of each mailbox in a non-public namespace, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by changing the ACL of a mailbox, as demonstrated by a symlinked shared mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3707] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving more specific entries that occur after less specific entries, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3706] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving the private namespace of a user, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3304] The ACL plugin in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.13 propagates INBOX ACLs to newly created mailboxes in certain configurations, which might allow remote attackers to read mailboxes that have unintended weak ACLs.
| [CVE-2010-0745] Unspecified vulnerability in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via long headers in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-0535] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6 before 10.6.3, when Kerberos is enabled, does not properly enforce the service access control list (SACL) for sending and receiving e-mail, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via unspecified vectors.
| [CVE-2010-0433] The kssl_keytab_is_available function in ssl/kssl.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8n, when Kerberos is enabled but Kerberos configuration files cannot be opened, does not check a certain return value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via SSL cipher negotiation, as demonstrated by a chroot installation of Dovecot or stunnel without Kerberos configuration files inside the chroot.
| [CVE-2009-3897] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.8 sets 0777 permissions during creation of certain directories at installation time, which allows local users to access arbitrary user accounts by replacing the auth socket, related to the parent directories of the base_dir directory, and possibly the base_dir directory itself.
| [CVE-2009-3235] Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Sieve plugin in Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, as derived from Cyrus libsieve, allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted SIEVE script, as demonstrated by forwarding an e-mail message to a large number of recipients, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2632.
| [CVE-2008-5301] Directory traversal vulnerability in the ManageSieve implementation in Dovecot 1.0.15, 1.1, and 1.2 allows remote attackers to read and modify arbitrary .sieve files via a ".." (dot dot) in a script name.
| [CVE-2008-4907] The message parsing feature in Dovecot 1.1.4 and 1.1.5, when using the FETCH ENVELOPE command in the IMAP client, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent crash) via an email with a malformed From address, which triggers an assertion error, aka "invalid message address parsing bug."
| [CVE-2008-4870] dovecot 1.0.7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5, and possibly Fedora, uses world-readable permissions for dovecot.conf, which allows local users to obtain the ssl_key_password parameter value.
| [CVE-2008-4578] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using the "k" right to create unauthorized "parent/child/child" mailboxes.
| [CVE-2008-4577] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 treats negative access rights as if they are positive access rights, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
| [CVE-2008-1218] Argument injection vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0.x before 1.0.13, and 1.1.x before 1.1.rc3, when using blocking passdbs, allows remote attackers to bypass the password check via a password containing TAB characters, which are treated as argument delimiters that enable the skip_password_check field to be specified.
| [CVE-2008-1199] Dovecot before 1.0.11, when configured to use mail_extra_groups to allow Dovecot to create dotlocks in /var/mail, might allow local users to read sensitive mail files for other users, or modify files or directories that are writable by group, via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2007-6598] Dovecot before 1.0.10, with certain configuration options including use of %variables, does not properly maintain the LDAP+auth cache, which might allow remote authenticated users to login as a different user who has the same password.
| [CVE-2007-5794] Race condition in nss_ldap, when used in applications that are linked against the pthread library and fork after a call to nss_ldap, might send user data to the wrong process because of improper handling of the LDAP connection. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for Dovecot with the wrong mailboxes being returned, but other applications might also be affected.
| [CVE-2007-5740] The format string protection mechanism in IMAPD for Perdition Mail Retrieval Proxy 1.17 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an IMAP tag with a null byte followed by a format string specifier, which is not counted by the mechanism.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2013-4124] Integer overflow in the read_nttrans_ea_list function in nttrans.c in smbd in Samba 3.x before 3.5.22, 3.6.x before 3.6.17, and 4.x before 4.0.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a malformed packet.
| [CVE-2011-0719] Samba 3.x before 3.3.15, 3.4.x before 3.4.12, and 3.5.x before 3.5.7 does not perform range checks for file descriptors before use of the FD_SET macro, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption, and infinite loop or daemon crash) by opening a large number of files, related to (1) Winbind or (2) smbd.
| [CVE-2013-0214] Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.21, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, and 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users by leveraging knowledge of a password and composing requests that perform SWAT actions.
| [CVE-2013-0213] The Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.21, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, and 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks via a (1) FRAME or (2) IFRAME element.
| [CVE-2012-1182] The RPC code generator in Samba 3.x before 3.4.16, 3.5.x before 3.5.14, and 3.6.x before 3.6.4 does not implement validation of an array length in a manner consistent with validation of array memory allocation, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted RPC call.
| [CVE-2011-2694] Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the chg_passwd function in web/swat.c in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.10 allows remote authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the username parameter to the passwd program (aka the user field to the Change Password page).
| [CVE-2011-2522] Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.10 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) shut down daemons, (2) start daemons, (3) add shares, (4) remove shares, (5) add printers, (6) remove printers, (7) add user accounts, or (8) remove user accounts, as demonstrated by certain start, stop, and restart parameters to the status program.
| [CVE-2004-0186] smbmnt in Samba 2.x and 3.x on Linux 2.6, when installed setuid, allows local users to gain root privileges by mounting a Samba share that contains a setuid root program, whose setuid attributes are not cleared when the share is mounted.
