| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2012-0814] The auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 5.7 provides debug messages containing authorized_keys command options, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information by reading these messages, as demonstrated by the shared user account required by Gitolite.  NOTE: this can cross privilege boundaries because a user account may intentionally have no shell or filesystem access, and therefore may have no supported way to read an authorized_keys file in its own home directory.
| [CVE-2011-5000] The ssh_gssapi_parse_ename function in gss-serv.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, when gssapi-with-mic authentication is enabled, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large value in a certain length field.  NOTE: there may be limited scenarios in which this issue is relevant.
| [CVE-2011-0539] The key_certify function in usr.bin/ssh/key.c in OpenSSH 5.6 and 5.7, when generating legacy certificates using the -t command-line option in ssh-keygen, does not initialize the nonce field, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive stack memory contents or make it easier to conduct hash collision attacks.
| [CVE-2010-4755] The (1) remote_glob function in sftp-glob.c and the (2) process_put function in sftp.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, as used in FreeBSD 7.3 and 8.1, NetBSD 5.0.2, OpenBSD 4.7, and other products, allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any pathnames, as demonstrated by glob expressions in SSH_FXP_STAT requests to an sftp daemon, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.
| [CVE-2010-4478] OpenSSH 5.6 and earlier, when J-PAKE is enabled, does not properly validate the public parameters in the J-PAKE protocol, which allows remote attackers to bypass the need for knowledge of the shared secret, and successfully authenticate, by sending crafted values in each round of the protocol, a related issue to CVE-2010-4252.
| [CVE-2009-2904] A certain Red Hat modification to the ChrootDirectory feature in OpenSSH 4.8, as used in sshd in OpenSSH 4.3 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.4 and Fedora 11, allows local users to gain privileges via hard links to setuid programs that use configuration files within the chroot directory, related to requirements for directory ownership.
| [CVE-2008-3844] Certain Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4 and 5 packages for OpenSSH, as signed in August 2008 using a legitimate Red Hat GPG key, contain an externally introduced modification (Trojan Horse) that allows the package authors to have an unknown impact.  NOTE: since the malicious packages were not distributed from any official Red Hat sources, the scope of this issue is restricted to users who may have obtained these packages through unofficial distribution points.  As of 20080827, no unofficial distributions of this software are known.
| [CVE-2008-3259] OpenSSH before 5.1 sets the SO_REUSEADDR socket option when the X11UseLocalhost configuration setting is disabled, which allows local users on some platforms to hijack the X11 forwarding port via a bind to a single IP address, as demonstrated on the HP-UX platform.
| [CVE-2006-0883] OpenSSH on FreeBSD 5.3 and 5.4, when used with OpenPAM, does not properly handle when a forked child process terminates during PAM authentication, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (client connection refusal) by connecting multiple times to the SSH server, waiting for the password prompt, then disconnecting.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2013-2852] Format string vulnerability in the b43_request_firmware function in drivers/net/wireless/b43/main.c in the Broadcom B43 wireless driver in the Linux kernel through 3.9.4 allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging root access and including format string specifiers in an fwpostfix modprobe parameter, leading to improper construction of an error message.
| [CVE-2011-1720] The SMTP server in Postfix before 2.5.13, 2.6.x before 2.6.10, 2.7.x before 2.7.4, and 2.8.x before 2.8.3, when certain Cyrus SASL authentication methods are enabled, does not create a new server handle after client authentication fails, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption and daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via an invalid AUTH command with one method followed by an AUTH command with a different method.
| [CVE-2011-0411] The STARTTLS implementation in Postfix 2.4.x before 2.4.16, 2.5.x before 2.5.12, 2.6.x before 2.6.9, and 2.7.x before 2.7.3 does not properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted SMTP sessions by sending a cleartext command that is processed after TLS is in place, related to a "plaintext command injection" attack.
| [CVE-2010-0230] SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP3 (SLE10-SP3) and openSUSE 11.2 configures postfix to listen on all network interfaces, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
| [CVE-2009-2939] The postfix.postinst script in the Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu postfix 2.5.5 package grants the postfix user write access to /var/spool/postfix/pid, which might allow local users to conduct symlink attacks that overwrite arbitrary files.
| [CVE-2008-4977] ** DISPUTED **  postfix_groups.pl in Postfix 2.5.2 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the (1) /tmp/postfix_groups.stdout, (2) /tmp/postfix_groups.stderr, and (3) /tmp/postfix_groups.message temporary files.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this vulnerability, stating "This is not a real issue ... users would have to edit a script under /usr/lib to enable it."
| [CVE-2008-3889] Postfix 2.4 before 2.4.9, 2.5 before 2.5.5, and 2.6 before 2.6-20080902, when used with the Linux 2.6 kernel, leaks epoll file descriptors during execution of "non-Postfix" commands, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (application slowdown or exit) via a crafted command, as demonstrated by a command in a .forward file.
| [CVE-2008-3646] The Postfix configuration file in Mac OS X 10.5.5 causes Postfix to be network-accessible when mail is sent from a local command-line tool, which allows remote attackers to send mail to local Mac OS X users.
| [CVE-2008-2937] Postfix 2.5 before 2.5.4 and 2.6 before 2.6-20080814 delivers to a mailbox file even when this file is not owned by the recipient, which allows local users to read e-mail messages by creating a mailbox file corresponding to another user's account name.
| [CVE-2008-2936] Postfix before 2.3.15, 2.4 before 2.4.8, 2.5 before 2.5.4, and 2.6 before 2.6-20080814, when the operating system supports hard links to symlinks, allows local users to append e-mail messages to a file to which a root-owned symlink points, by creating a hard link to this symlink and then sending a message.  NOTE: this can be leveraged to gain privileges if there is a symlink to an init script.
| [CVE-2007-3791] Buffer overflow in the w_read function in sockets.c in Cami Sardinha and Nigel Kukard policyd before 1.81 for Postfix allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via long SMTP commands.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
| [CVE-2006-0213] Kolab Server 2.0.1, 2.0.2 and development versions pre-2.1-20051215 and earlier, when authenticating users via secure SMTP, stores authentication credentials in plaintext in the postfix.log file, which allows local users to gain privileges.
| [CVE-2005-1127] Format string vulnerability in the log function in Net::Server 0.87 and earlier, as used in Postfix Greylisting Policy Server (Postgrey) 1.18 and earlier, and possibly other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via format string specifiers that are not properly handled before being sent to syslog, as demonstrated using sender addresses to Postgrey.
| [CVE-2005-0337] Postfix 2.1.3, when /proc/net/if_inet6 is not available and permit_mx_backup is enabled in smtpd_recipient_restrictions, allows remote attackers to bypass e-mail restrictions and perform mail relaying by sending mail to an IPv6 hostname.
| [CVE-2004-1113] SQL injection vulnerability in SQLgrey Postfix greylisting service before 1.2.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) sender or (2) recipient e-mail addresses.
| [CVE-2004-1088] Postfix server for Apple Mac OS X 10.3.6, when using CRAM-MD5, allows remote attackers to send mail without authentication by replaying authentication information.
| [CVE-2004-0925] Postfix on Mac OS X 10.3.x through 10.3.5, with SMTPD AUTH enabled, does not properly clear the username between authentication attempts, which allows users with the longest username to prevent other valid users from being able to authenticate.
| [CVE-2003-0540] The address parser code in Postfix 1.1.12 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (lock) via (1) a malformed envelope address to a local host that would generate a bounce and contains the ".!" string in the MAIL FROM or Errors-To headers, which causes nqmgr to lock up, or (2) via a valid MAIL FROM with a RCPT TO containing a ".!" string, which causes an instance of the SMTP listener to lock up.
| [CVE-2003-0468] Postfix 1.1.11 and earlier allows remote attackers to use Postfix to conduct "bounce scans" or DDos attacks of other hosts via an email address to the local host containing the target IP address and service name followed by a "!" string, which causes Postfix to attempt to use SMTP to communicate with the target on the associated port.
| [CVE-2001-0894] Vulnerability in Postfix SMTP server before 20010228-pl07, when configured to email the postmaster when SMTP errors cause the session to terminate, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) by generating a large number of SMTP errors, which forces the SMTP session log to grow too large.

| [CVE-2013-1048] The Debian apache2ctl script in the apache2 package squeeze before 2.2.16-6+squeeze11, wheezy before 2.2.22-13, and sid before 2.2.22-13 for the Apache HTTP Server on Debian GNU/Linux does not properly create the /var/lock/apache2 lock directory, which allows local users to gain privileges via an unspecified symlink attack.
| [CVE-2012-0216] The default configuration of the apache2 package in Debian GNU/Linux squeeze before 2.2.16-6+squeeze7, wheezy before 2.2.22-4, and sid before 2.2.22-4, when mod_php or mod_rivet is used, provides example scripts under the doc/ URI, which might allow local users to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, gain privileges, or obtain sensitive information via vectors involving localhost HTTP requests to the Apache HTTP Server.
| [CVE-2013-1896] mod_dav.c in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.25 does not properly determine whether DAV is enabled for a URI, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a MERGE request in which the URI is configured for handling by the mod_dav_svn module, but a certain href attribute in XML data refers to a non-DAV URI.
| [CVE-2013-1862] mod_rewrite.c in the mod_rewrite module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.25 writes data to a log file without sanitizing non-printable characters, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via an HTTP request containing an escape sequence for a terminal emulator.
| [CVE-2013-1768] The BrokerFactory functionality in Apache OpenJPA 1.x before 1.2.3 and 2.x before 2.2.2 creates local executable JSP files containing logging trace data produced during deserialization of certain crafted OpenJPA objects, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by creating a serialized object and leveraging improperly secured server programs.
| [CVE-2012-4558] Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the balancer_handler function in the manager interface in mod_proxy_balancer.c in the mod_proxy_balancer module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.24-dev and 2.4.x before 2.4.4 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted string.
| [CVE-2012-4557] The mod_proxy_ajp module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.12 through 2.2.21 places a worker node into an error state upon detection of a long request-processing time, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (worker consumption) via an expensive request.
| [CVE-2012-3499] Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.24-dev and 2.4.x before 2.4.4 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving hostnames and URIs in the (1) mod_imagemap, (2) mod_info, (3) mod_ldap, (4) mod_proxy_ftp, and (5) mod_status modules.
| [CVE-2012-0053] protocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x through 2.2.21 does not properly restrict header information during construction of Bad Request (aka 400) error documents, which allows remote attackers to obtain the values of HTTPOnly cookies via vectors involving a (1) long or (2) malformed header in conjunction with crafted web script.
| [CVE-2012-0031] scoreboard.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.21 and earlier might allow local users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash during shutdown) or possibly have unspecified other impact by modifying a certain type field within a scoreboard shared memory segment, leading to an invalid call to the free function.
| [CVE-2012-0021] The log_cookie function in mod_log_config.c in the mod_log_config module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.17 through 2.2.21, when a threaded MPM is used, does not properly handle a %{}C format string, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a cookie that lacks both a name and a value.
| [CVE-2011-4415] The ap_pregsub function in server/util.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64 and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the mod_setenvif module is enabled, does not restrict the size of values of environment variables, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or NULL pointer dereference) via a .htaccess file with a crafted SetEnvIf directive, in conjunction with a crafted HTTP request header, related to (1) the "len +=" statement and (2) the apr_pcalloc function call, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-3607.
| [CVE-2011-4317] The mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.x through 1.3.42, 2.0.x through 2.0.64, and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the Revision 1179239 patch is in place, does not properly interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2) ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for configuration of a reverse proxy, which allows remote attackers to send requests to intranet servers via a malformed URI containing an @ (at sign) character and a : (colon) character in invalid positions.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-3368.
| [CVE-2011-3607] Integer overflow in the ap_pregsub function in server/util.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64 and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the mod_setenvif module is enabled, allows local users to gain privileges via a .htaccess file with a crafted SetEnvIf directive, in conjunction with a crafted HTTP request header, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
| [CVE-2011-3368] The mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.x through 1.3.42, 2.0.x through 2.0.64, and 2.2.x through 2.2.21 does not properly interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2) ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for configuration of a reverse proxy, which allows remote attackers to send requests to intranet servers via a malformed URI containing an initial @ (at sign) character.
| [CVE-2011-3348] The mod_proxy_ajp module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.21, when used with mod_proxy_balancer in certain configurations, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (temporary "error state" in the backend server) via a malformed HTTP request.
| [CVE-2006-4110] Apache 2.2.2, when running on Windows, allows remote attackers to read source code of CGI programs via a request that contains uppercase (or alternate case) characters that bypass the case-sensitive ScriptAlias directive, but allow access to the file on case-insensitive file systems.
| [CVE-2006-3918] http_protocol.c in (1) IBM HTTP Server 6.0 before 6.0.2.13 and 6.1 before 6.1.0.1, and (2) Apache HTTP Server 1.3 before 1.3.35, 2.0 before 2.0.58, and 2.2 before 2.2.2, does not sanitize the Expect header from an HTTP request when it is reflected back in an error message, which might allow cross-site scripting (XSS) style attacks using web client components that can send arbitrary headers in requests, as demonstrated using a Flash SWF file.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2011-4318] Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.16, when ssl or starttls is enabled and hostname is used to define the proxy destination, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a valid certificate for a different hostname.
| [CVE-2011-2167] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the chroot configuration setting, which might allow remote authenticated users to conduct directory traversal attacks by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-2166] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the user and group configuration settings, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-1929] lib-mail/message-header-parser.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.17 and 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not properly handle '\0' characters in header names, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash or mailbox corruption) via a crafted e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-4011] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6.5 10H574 does not properly manage memory for user names, which allows remote authenticated users to read the private e-mail of other persons in opportunistic circumstances via standard e-mail clients accessing a user's own mailbox, related to a "memory aliasing issue."
| [CVE-2010-3780] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (master process outage) by simultaneously disconnecting many (1) IMAP or (2) POP3 sessions.
| [CVE-2010-3779] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.beta2 grants the admin permission to the owner of each mailbox in a non-public namespace, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by changing the ACL of a mailbox, as demonstrated by a symlinked shared mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3707] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving more specific entries that occur after less specific entries, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3706] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving the private namespace of a user, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3304] The ACL plugin in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.13 propagates INBOX ACLs to newly created mailboxes in certain configurations, which might allow remote attackers to read mailboxes that have unintended weak ACLs.
| [CVE-2010-0745] Unspecified vulnerability in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via long headers in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-0535] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6 before 10.6.3, when Kerberos is enabled, does not properly enforce the service access control list (SACL) for sending and receiving e-mail, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via unspecified vectors.
| [CVE-2010-0433] The kssl_keytab_is_available function in ssl/kssl.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8n, when Kerberos is enabled but Kerberos configuration files cannot be opened, does not check a certain return value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via SSL cipher negotiation, as demonstrated by a chroot installation of Dovecot or stunnel without Kerberos configuration files inside the chroot.
| [CVE-2009-3897] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.8 sets 0777 permissions during creation of certain directories at installation time, which allows local users to access arbitrary user accounts by replacing the auth socket, related to the parent directories of the base_dir directory, and possibly the base_dir directory itself.
| [CVE-2009-3235] Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Sieve plugin in Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, as derived from Cyrus libsieve, allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted SIEVE script, as demonstrated by forwarding an e-mail message to a large number of recipients, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2632.
| [CVE-2009-2632] Buffer overflow in the SIEVE script component (sieve/script.c), as used in cyrus-imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.13 and 2.3.14, and Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, allows local users to execute arbitrary code and read or modify arbitrary messages via a crafted SIEVE script, related to the incorrect use of the sizeof operator for determining buffer length, combined with an integer signedness error.
| [CVE-2008-5301] Directory traversal vulnerability in the ManageSieve implementation in Dovecot 1.0.15, 1.1, and 1.2 allows remote attackers to read and modify arbitrary .sieve files via a ".." (dot dot) in a script name.
| [CVE-2008-4907] The message parsing feature in Dovecot 1.1.4 and 1.1.5, when using the FETCH ENVELOPE command in the IMAP client, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent crash) via an email with a malformed From address, which triggers an assertion error, aka "invalid message address parsing bug."
| [CVE-2008-4870] dovecot 1.0.7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5, and possibly Fedora, uses world-readable permissions for dovecot.conf, which allows local users to obtain the ssl_key_password parameter value.
| [CVE-2008-4578] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using the "k" right to create unauthorized "parent/child/child" mailboxes.
| [CVE-2008-4577] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 treats negative access rights as if they are positive access rights, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
| [CVE-2008-1218] Argument injection vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0.x before 1.0.13, and 1.1.x before 1.1.rc3, when using blocking passdbs, allows remote attackers to bypass the password check via a password containing TAB characters, which are treated as argument delimiters that enable the skip_password_check field to be specified.
| [CVE-2008-1199] Dovecot before 1.0.11, when configured to use mail_extra_groups to allow Dovecot to create dotlocks in /var/mail, might allow local users to read sensitive mail files for other users, or modify files or directories that are writable by group, via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2007-6598] Dovecot before 1.0.10, with certain configuration options including use of %variables, does not properly maintain the LDAP+auth cache, which might allow remote authenticated users to login as a different user who has the same password.
| [CVE-2007-5794] Race condition in nss_ldap, when used in applications that are linked against the pthread library and fork after a call to nss_ldap, might send user data to the wrong process because of improper handling of the LDAP connection. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for Dovecot with the wrong mailboxes being returned, but other applications might also be affected.
| [CVE-2007-4211] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.0.3 allows remote authenticated users with the insert right to save certain flags via a (1) COPY or (2) APPEND command.
| [CVE-2007-2231] Directory traversal vulnerability in index/mbox/mbox-storage.c in Dovecot before 1.0.rc29, when using the zlib plugin, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary gzipped (.gz) mailboxes (mbox files) via a .. (dot dot) sequence in the mailbox name.
| [CVE-2007-2173] Eval injection vulnerability in (1) courier-imapd.indirect and (2) courier-pop3d.indirect in Courier-IMAP before 4.0.6-r2, and 4.1.x before 4.1.2-r1, on Gentoo Linux allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the XMAILDIR variable, related to the LOGINRUN variable.
| [CVE-2007-0618] Unspecified vulnerability in (1) pop3d, (2) pop3ds, (3) imapd, and (4) imapds in IBM AIX 5.3.0 has unspecified impact and attack vectors, involving an "authentication vulnerability."
| [CVE-2006-5973] Off-by-one buffer overflow in Dovecot 1.0test53 through 1.0.rc14, and possibly other versions, when index files are used and mmap_disable is set to "yes," allows remote authenticated IMAP or POP3 users to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors involving the cache file.
| [CVE-2006-2502] Stack-based buffer overflow in pop3d in Cyrus IMAPD (cyrus-imapd) 2.3.2, when the popsubfolders option is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long USER command.
| [CVE-2006-2414] Directory traversal vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0 beta and 1.0 allows remote attackers to list files and directories under the mbox parent directory and obtain mailbox names via ".." sequences in the (1) LIST or (2) DELETE IMAP command.
| [CVE-2006-0730] Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Dovecot before 1.0beta3 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash or hang) via unspecified vectors involving (1) "potential hangs" in the APPEND command and "potential crashes" in (2) dovecot-auth and (3) imap/pop3-login.  NOTE: vector 2 might be related to a double free vulnerability.
| [CVE-2002-0925] Format string vulnerability in mmsyslog function allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) the USER command to mmpop3d for mmmail 0.0.13 and earlier, (2) the HELO command to mmsmtpd for mmmail 0.0.13 and earlier, or (3) the USER command to mmftpd 0.0.7 and earlier.
| [CVE-2001-0143] vpop3d program in linuxconf 1.23r and earlier allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2000-1197] POP2 or POP3 server (pop3d) in imap-uw IMAP package on FreeBSD and other operating systems creates lock files with predictable names, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (lack of mail access) for other users by creating lock files for other mail boxes.
| [CVE-1999-1445] Vulnerability in imapd and ipop3d in Slackware 3.4 and 3.3 with shadowing enabled, and possibly other operating systems, allows remote attackers to cause a core dump via a short sequence of USER and PASS commands that do not provide valid usernames or passwords.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2009-2632] Buffer overflow in the SIEVE script component (sieve/script.c), as used in cyrus-imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.13 and 2.3.14, and Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, allows local users to execute arbitrary code and read or modify arbitrary messages via a crafted SIEVE script, related to the incorrect use of the sizeof operator for determining buffer length, combined with an integer signedness error.
| [CVE-2011-4318] Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.16, when ssl or starttls is enabled and hostname is used to define the proxy destination, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a valid certificate for a different hostname.
| [CVE-2011-3481] The index_get_ids function in index.c in imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server before 2.4.11, when server-side threading is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a crafted References header in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2011-3372] imap/nntpd.c in the NNTP server (nntpd) for Cyrus IMAPd 2.4.x before 2.4.12 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by sending an AUTHINFO USER command without sending an additional AUTHINFO PASS command.
| [CVE-2011-2167] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the chroot configuration setting, which might allow remote authenticated users to conduct directory traversal attacks by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-2166] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the user and group configuration settings, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-1929] lib-mail/message-header-parser.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.17 and 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not properly handle '\0' characters in header names, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash or mailbox corruption) via a crafted e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-4011] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6.5 10H574 does not properly manage memory for user names, which allows remote authenticated users to read the private e-mail of other persons in opportunistic circumstances via standard e-mail clients accessing a user's own mailbox, related to a "memory aliasing issue."
| [CVE-2010-3780] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (master process outage) by simultaneously disconnecting many (1) IMAP or (2) POP3 sessions.
| [CVE-2010-3779] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.beta2 grants the admin permission to the owner of each mailbox in a non-public namespace, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by changing the ACL of a mailbox, as demonstrated by a symlinked shared mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3707] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving more specific entries that occur after less specific entries, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3706] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving the private namespace of a user, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3304] The ACL plugin in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.13 propagates INBOX ACLs to newly created mailboxes in certain configurations, which might allow remote attackers to read mailboxes that have unintended weak ACLs.
| [CVE-2010-0745] Unspecified vulnerability in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via long headers in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-0535] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6 before 10.6.3, when Kerberos is enabled, does not properly enforce the service access control list (SACL) for sending and receiving e-mail, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via unspecified vectors.
| [CVE-2010-0433] The kssl_keytab_is_available function in ssl/kssl.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8n, when Kerberos is enabled but Kerberos configuration files cannot be opened, does not check a certain return value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via SSL cipher negotiation, as demonstrated by a chroot installation of Dovecot or stunnel without Kerberos configuration files inside the chroot.
| [CVE-2009-3897] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.8 sets 0777 permissions during creation of certain directories at installation time, which allows local users to access arbitrary user accounts by replacing the auth socket, related to the parent directories of the base_dir directory, and possibly the base_dir directory itself.
| [CVE-2009-3235] Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Sieve plugin in Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, as derived from Cyrus libsieve, allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted SIEVE script, as demonstrated by forwarding an e-mail message to a large number of recipients, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2632.
| [CVE-2008-5301] Directory traversal vulnerability in the ManageSieve implementation in Dovecot 1.0.15, 1.1, and 1.2 allows remote attackers to read and modify arbitrary .sieve files via a ".." (dot dot) in a script name.
| [CVE-2008-4907] The message parsing feature in Dovecot 1.1.4 and 1.1.5, when using the FETCH ENVELOPE command in the IMAP client, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent crash) via an email with a malformed From address, which triggers an assertion error, aka "invalid message address parsing bug."
| [CVE-2008-4870] dovecot 1.0.7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5, and possibly Fedora, uses world-readable permissions for dovecot.conf, which allows local users to obtain the ssl_key_password parameter value.
| [CVE-2008-4578] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using the "k" right to create unauthorized "parent/child/child" mailboxes.
| [CVE-2008-4577] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 treats negative access rights as if they are positive access rights, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
| [CVE-2008-1218] Argument injection vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0.x before 1.0.13, and 1.1.x before 1.1.rc3, when using blocking passdbs, allows remote attackers to bypass the password check via a password containing TAB characters, which are treated as argument delimiters that enable the skip_password_check field to be specified.
| [CVE-2008-1199] Dovecot before 1.0.11, when configured to use mail_extra_groups to allow Dovecot to create dotlocks in /var/mail, might allow local users to read sensitive mail files for other users, or modify files or directories that are writable by group, via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2007-6598] Dovecot before 1.0.10, with certain configuration options including use of %variables, does not properly maintain the LDAP+auth cache, which might allow remote authenticated users to login as a different user who has the same password.
| [CVE-2007-5794] Race condition in nss_ldap, when used in applications that are linked against the pthread library and fork after a call to nss_ldap, might send user data to the wrong process because of improper handling of the LDAP connection. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for Dovecot with the wrong mailboxes being returned, but other applications might also be affected.
| [CVE-2007-5740] The format string protection mechanism in IMAPD for Perdition Mail Retrieval Proxy 1.17 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an IMAP tag with a null byte followed by a format string specifier, which is not counted by the mechanism.
| [CVE-2007-5018] Stack-based buffer overflow in IMAPD in Mercury/32 4.52 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a long argument in a SEARCH ON command.  NOTE: this issue might overlap with CVE-2004-1211.
| [CVE-2007-4211] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.0.3 allows remote authenticated users with the insert right to save certain flags via a (1) COPY or (2) APPEND command.
| [CVE-2007-3925] Multiple buffer overflows in the IMAP service (imapd32.exe) in Ipswitch IMail Server 2006 before 2006.21 allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via the (1) Search or (2) Search Charset command.
| [CVE-2007-2231] Directory traversal vulnerability in index/mbox/mbox-storage.c in Dovecot before 1.0.rc29, when using the zlib plugin, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary gzipped (.gz) mailboxes (mbox files) via a .. (dot dot) sequence in the mailbox name.
| [CVE-2007-2173] Eval injection vulnerability in (1) courier-imapd.indirect and (2) courier-pop3d.indirect in Courier-IMAP before 4.0.6-r2, and 4.1.x before 4.1.2-r1, on Gentoo Linux allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the XMAILDIR variable, related to the LOGINRUN variable.
| [CVE-2007-1579] Stack-based buffer overflow in Atrium MERCUR IMAPD allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via a certain SUBSCRIBE command.
| [CVE-2007-1578] Multiple integer signedness errors in the NTLM implementation in Atrium MERCUR IMAPD (mcrimap4.exe) 5.00.14, with SP4, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long NTLMSSP argument that triggers a stack-based buffer overflow.
| [CVE-2007-0618] Unspecified vulnerability in (1) pop3d, (2) pop3ds, (3) imapd, and (4) imapds in IBM AIX 5.3.0 has unspecified impact and attack vectors, involving an "authentication vulnerability."
| [CVE-2006-6762] The IMAP daemon (IMAPD) in Novell NetMail before 3.52e FTF2 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service via an APPEND command with a single "(" (parenthesis) in the argument.

| [CVE-1999-1445] Vulnerability in imapd and ipop3d in Slackware 3.4 and 3.3 with shadowing enabled, and possibly other operating systems, allows remote attackers to cause a core dump via a short sequence of USER and PASS commands that do not provide valid usernames or passwords.
| [CVE-1999-1224] IMAP 4.1 BETA, and possibly other versions, does not properly handle the SIGABRT (abort) signal, which allows local users to crash the server (imapd) via certain sequences of commands, which causes a core dump that may contain sensitive password information.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2009-2632] Buffer overflow in the SIEVE script component (sieve/script.c), as used in cyrus-imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.13 and 2.3.14, and Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, allows local users to execute arbitrary code and read or modify arbitrary messages via a crafted SIEVE script, related to the incorrect use of the sizeof operator for determining buffer length, combined with an integer signedness error.
| [CVE-2011-4318] Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.16, when ssl or starttls is enabled and hostname is used to define the proxy destination, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a valid certificate for a different hostname.
| [CVE-2011-3481] The index_get_ids function in index.c in imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server before 2.4.11, when server-side threading is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a crafted References header in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2011-3372] imap/nntpd.c in the NNTP server (nntpd) for Cyrus IMAPd 2.4.x before 2.4.12 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by sending an AUTHINFO USER command without sending an additional AUTHINFO PASS command.
| [CVE-2011-2167] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the chroot configuration setting, which might allow remote authenticated users to conduct directory traversal attacks by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-2166] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the user and group configuration settings, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-1929] lib-mail/message-header-parser.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.17 and 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not properly handle '\0' characters in header names, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash or mailbox corruption) via a crafted e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-4011] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6.5 10H574 does not properly manage memory for user names, which allows remote authenticated users to read the private e-mail of other persons in opportunistic circumstances via standard e-mail clients accessing a user's own mailbox, related to a "memory aliasing issue."
| [CVE-2010-3780] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (master process outage) by simultaneously disconnecting many (1) IMAP or (2) POP3 sessions.
| [CVE-2010-3779] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.beta2 grants the admin permission to the owner of each mailbox in a non-public namespace, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by changing the ACL of a mailbox, as demonstrated by a symlinked shared mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3707] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving more specific entries that occur after less specific entries, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3706] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving the private namespace of a user, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3304] The ACL plugin in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.13 propagates INBOX ACLs to newly created mailboxes in certain configurations, which might allow remote attackers to read mailboxes that have unintended weak ACLs.
| [CVE-2010-0745] Unspecified vulnerability in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via long headers in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-0535] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6 before 10.6.3, when Kerberos is enabled, does not properly enforce the service access control list (SACL) for sending and receiving e-mail, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via unspecified vectors.
| [CVE-2010-0433] The kssl_keytab_is_available function in ssl/kssl.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8n, when Kerberos is enabled but Kerberos configuration files cannot be opened, does not check a certain return value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via SSL cipher negotiation, as demonstrated by a chroot installation of Dovecot or stunnel without Kerberos configuration files inside the chroot.
| [CVE-2009-3897] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.8 sets 0777 permissions during creation of certain directories at installation time, which allows local users to access arbitrary user accounts by replacing the auth socket, related to the parent directories of the base_dir directory, and possibly the base_dir directory itself.
| [CVE-2009-3235] Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Sieve plugin in Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, as derived from Cyrus libsieve, allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted SIEVE script, as demonstrated by forwarding an e-mail message to a large number of recipients, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2632.
| [CVE-2008-5301] Directory traversal vulnerability in the ManageSieve implementation in Dovecot 1.0.15, 1.1, and 1.2 allows remote attackers to read and modify arbitrary .sieve files via a ".." (dot dot) in a script name.
| [CVE-2008-4907] The message parsing feature in Dovecot 1.1.4 and 1.1.5, when using the FETCH ENVELOPE command in the IMAP client, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent crash) via an email with a malformed From address, which triggers an assertion error, aka "invalid message address parsing bug."
| [CVE-2008-4870] dovecot 1.0.7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5, and possibly Fedora, uses world-readable permissions for dovecot.conf, which allows local users to obtain the ssl_key_password parameter value.
| [CVE-2008-4578] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using the "k" right to create unauthorized "parent/child/child" mailboxes.
| [CVE-2008-4577] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 treats negative access rights as if they are positive access rights, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
| [CVE-2008-1218] Argument injection vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0.x before 1.0.13, and 1.1.x before 1.1.rc3, when using blocking passdbs, allows remote attackers to bypass the password check via a password containing TAB characters, which are treated as argument delimiters that enable the skip_password_check field to be specified.
| [CVE-2008-1199] Dovecot before 1.0.11, when configured to use mail_extra_groups to allow Dovecot to create dotlocks in /var/mail, might allow local users to read sensitive mail files for other users, or modify files or directories that are writable by group, via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2007-6598] Dovecot before 1.0.10, with certain configuration options including use of %variables, does not properly maintain the LDAP+auth cache, which might allow remote authenticated users to login as a different user who has the same password.
| [CVE-2007-5794] Race condition in nss_ldap, when used in applications that are linked against the pthread library and fork after a call to nss_ldap, might send user data to the wrong process because of improper handling of the LDAP connection. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for Dovecot with the wrong mailboxes being returned, but other applications might also be affected.
| [CVE-2007-5740] The format string protection mechanism in IMAPD for Perdition Mail Retrieval Proxy 1.17 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an IMAP tag with a null byte followed by a format string specifier, which is not counted by the mechanism.
| [CVE-2007-5018] Stack-based buffer overflow in IMAPD in Mercury/32 4.52 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a long argument in a SEARCH ON command.  NOTE: this issue might overlap with CVE-2004-1211.

| [CVE-2007-2231] Directory traversal vulnerability in index/mbox/mbox-storage.c in Dovecot before 1.0.rc29, when using the zlib plugin, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary gzipped (.gz) mailboxes (mbox files) via a .. (dot dot) sequence in the mailbox name.
| [CVE-2007-2173] Eval injection vulnerability in (1) courier-imapd.indirect and (2) courier-pop3d.indirect in Courier-IMAP before 4.0.6-r2, and 4.1.x before 4.1.2-r1, on Gentoo Linux allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the XMAILDIR variable, related to the LOGINRUN variable.
| [CVE-2007-1579] Stack-based buffer overflow in Atrium MERCUR IMAPD allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via a certain SUBSCRIBE command.
| [CVE-2007-1578] Multiple integer signedness errors in the NTLM implementation in Atrium MERCUR IMAPD (mcrimap4.exe) 5.00.14, with SP4, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long NTLMSSP argument that triggers a stack-based buffer overflow.
| [CVE-2007-0618] Unspecified vulnerability in (1) pop3d, (2) pop3ds, (3) imapd, and (4) imapds in IBM AIX 5.3.0 has unspecified impact and attack vectors, involving an "authentication vulnerability."

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2011-4318] Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.16, when ssl or starttls is enabled and hostname is used to define the proxy destination, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a valid certificate for a different hostname.
| [CVE-2011-2167] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the chroot configuration setting, which might allow remote authenticated users to conduct directory traversal attacks by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-2166] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the user and group configuration settings, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-1929] lib-mail/message-header-parser.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.17 and 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not properly handle '\0' characters in header names, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash or mailbox corruption) via a crafted e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-4011] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6.5 10H574 does not properly manage memory for user names, which allows remote authenticated users to read the private e-mail of other persons in opportunistic circumstances via standard e-mail clients accessing a user's own mailbox, related to a "memory aliasing issue."
| [CVE-2010-3780] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (master process outage) by simultaneously disconnecting many (1) IMAP or (2) POP3 sessions.
| [CVE-2010-3779] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.beta2 grants the admin permission to the owner of each mailbox in a non-public namespace, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by changing the ACL of a mailbox, as demonstrated by a symlinked shared mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3707] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving more specific entries that occur after less specific entries, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3706] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving the private namespace of a user, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3304] The ACL plugin in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.13 propagates INBOX ACLs to newly created mailboxes in certain configurations, which might allow remote attackers to read mailboxes that have unintended weak ACLs.
| [CVE-2010-0745] Unspecified vulnerability in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via long headers in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-0535] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6 before 10.6.3, when Kerberos is enabled, does not properly enforce the service access control list (SACL) for sending and receiving e-mail, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via unspecified vectors.
| [CVE-2010-0433] The kssl_keytab_is_available function in ssl/kssl.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8n, when Kerberos is enabled but Kerberos configuration files cannot be opened, does not check a certain return value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via SSL cipher negotiation, as demonstrated by a chroot installation of Dovecot or stunnel without Kerberos configuration files inside the chroot.
| [CVE-2009-3897] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.8 sets 0777 permissions during creation of certain directories at installation time, which allows local users to access arbitrary user accounts by replacing the auth socket, related to the parent directories of the base_dir directory, and possibly the base_dir directory itself.
| [CVE-2009-3235] Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Sieve plugin in Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, as derived from Cyrus libsieve, allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted SIEVE script, as demonstrated by forwarding an e-mail message to a large number of recipients, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2632.
| [CVE-2009-2632] Buffer overflow in the SIEVE script component (sieve/script.c), as used in cyrus-imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.13 and 2.3.14, and Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, allows local users to execute arbitrary code and read or modify arbitrary messages via a crafted SIEVE script, related to the incorrect use of the sizeof operator for determining buffer length, combined with an integer signedness error.
| [CVE-2008-5301] Directory traversal vulnerability in the ManageSieve implementation in Dovecot 1.0.15, 1.1, and 1.2 allows remote attackers to read and modify arbitrary .sieve files via a ".." (dot dot) in a script name.
| [CVE-2008-4907] The message parsing feature in Dovecot 1.1.4 and 1.1.5, when using the FETCH ENVELOPE command in the IMAP client, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent crash) via an email with a malformed From address, which triggers an assertion error, aka "invalid message address parsing bug."
| [CVE-2008-4870] dovecot 1.0.7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5, and possibly Fedora, uses world-readable permissions for dovecot.conf, which allows local users to obtain the ssl_key_password parameter value.
| [CVE-2008-4578] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using the "k" right to create unauthorized "parent/child/child" mailboxes.
| [CVE-2008-4577] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 treats negative access rights as if they are positive access rights, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
| [CVE-2008-1218] Argument injection vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0.x before 1.0.13, and 1.1.x before 1.1.rc3, when using blocking passdbs, allows remote attackers to bypass the password check via a password containing TAB characters, which are treated as argument delimiters that enable the skip_password_check field to be specified.
| [CVE-2008-1199] Dovecot before 1.0.11, when configured to use mail_extra_groups to allow Dovecot to create dotlocks in /var/mail, might allow local users to read sensitive mail files for other users, or modify files or directories that are writable by group, via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2007-6598] Dovecot before 1.0.10, with certain configuration options including use of %variables, does not properly maintain the LDAP+auth cache, which might allow remote authenticated users to login as a different user who has the same password.
| [CVE-2007-5794] Race condition in nss_ldap, when used in applications that are linked against the pthread library and fork after a call to nss_ldap, might send user data to the wrong process because of improper handling of the LDAP connection. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for Dovecot with the wrong mailboxes being returned, but other applications might also be affected.
| [CVE-2007-4211] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.0.3 allows remote authenticated users with the insert right to save certain flags via a (1) COPY or (2) APPEND command.
| [CVE-2007-2231] Directory traversal vulnerability in index/mbox/mbox-storage.c in Dovecot before 1.0.rc29, when using the zlib plugin, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary gzipped (.gz) mailboxes (mbox files) via a .. (dot dot) sequence in the mailbox name.
| [CVE-2007-2173] Eval injection vulnerability in (1) courier-imapd.indirect and (2) courier-pop3d.indirect in Courier-IMAP before 4.0.6-r2, and 4.1.x before 4.1.2-r1, on Gentoo Linux allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the XMAILDIR variable, related to the LOGINRUN variable.
| [CVE-2007-0618] Unspecified vulnerability in (1) pop3d, (2) pop3ds, (3) imapd, and (4) imapds in IBM AIX 5.3.0 has unspecified impact and attack vectors, involving an "authentication vulnerability."
| [CVE-2006-5973] Off-by-one buffer overflow in Dovecot 1.0test53 through 1.0.rc14, and possibly other versions, when index files are used and mmap_disable is set to "yes," allows remote authenticated IMAP or POP3 users to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors involving the cache file.
| [CVE-2006-2502] Stack-based buffer overflow in pop3d in Cyrus IMAPD (cyrus-imapd) 2.3.2, when the popsubfolders option is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long USER command.
| [CVE-2006-2414] Directory traversal vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0 beta and 1.0 allows remote attackers to list files and directories under the mbox parent directory and obtain mailbox names via ".." sequences in the (1) LIST or (2) DELETE IMAP command.
| [CVE-2006-0730] Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Dovecot before 1.0beta3 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash or hang) via unspecified vectors involving (1) "potential hangs" in the APPEND command and "potential crashes" in (2) dovecot-auth and (3) imap/pop3-login.  NOTE: vector 2 might be related to a double free vulnerability.
| [CVE-2002-0925] Format string vulnerability in mmsyslog function allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) the USER command to mmpop3d for mmmail 0.0.13 and earlier, (2) the HELO command to mmsmtpd for mmmail 0.0.13 and earlier, or (3) the USER command to mmftpd 0.0.7 and earlier.
| [CVE-2001-0143] vpop3d program in linuxconf 1.23r and earlier allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2000-1197] POP2 or POP3 server (pop3d) in imap-uw IMAP package on FreeBSD and other operating systems creates lock files with predictable names, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (lack of mail access) for other users by creating lock files for other mail boxes.
| [CVE-1999-1445] Vulnerability in imapd and ipop3d in Slackware 3.4 and 3.3 with shadowing enabled, and possibly other operating systems, allows remote attackers to cause a core dump via a short sequence of USER and PASS commands that do not provide valid usernames or passwords.
