| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2012-0814] The auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 5.7 provides debug messages containing authorized_keys command options, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information by reading these messages, as demonstrated by the shared user account required by Gitolite.  NOTE: this can cross privilege boundaries because a user account may intentionally have no shell or filesystem access, and therefore may have no supported way to read an authorized_keys file in its own home directory.
| [CVE-2011-5000] The ssh_gssapi_parse_ename function in gss-serv.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, when gssapi-with-mic authentication is enabled, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large value in a certain length field.  NOTE: there may be limited scenarios in which this issue is relevant.
| [CVE-2011-0539] The key_certify function in usr.bin/ssh/key.c in OpenSSH 5.6 and 5.7, when generating legacy certificates using the -t command-line option in ssh-keygen, does not initialize the nonce field, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive stack memory contents or make it easier to conduct hash collision attacks.
| [CVE-2010-4755] The (1) remote_glob function in sftp-glob.c and the (2) process_put function in sftp.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, as used in FreeBSD 7.3 and 8.1, NetBSD 5.0.2, OpenBSD 4.7, and other products, allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any pathnames, as demonstrated by glob expressions in SSH_FXP_STAT requests to an sftp daemon, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.
| [CVE-2010-4478] OpenSSH 5.6 and earlier, when J-PAKE is enabled, does not properly validate the public parameters in the J-PAKE protocol, which allows remote attackers to bypass the need for knowledge of the shared secret, and successfully authenticate, by sending crafted values in each round of the protocol, a related issue to CVE-2010-4252.
| [CVE-2009-2904] A certain Red Hat modification to the ChrootDirectory feature in OpenSSH 4.8, as used in sshd in OpenSSH 4.3 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5.4 and Fedora 11, allows local users to gain privileges via hard links to setuid programs that use configuration files within the chroot directory, related to requirements for directory ownership.
| [CVE-2008-3844] Certain Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4 and 5 packages for OpenSSH, as signed in August 2008 using a legitimate Red Hat GPG key, contain an externally introduced modification (Trojan Horse) that allows the package authors to have an unknown impact.  NOTE: since the malicious packages were not distributed from any official Red Hat sources, the scope of this issue is restricted to users who may have obtained these packages through unofficial distribution points.  As of 20080827, no unofficial distributions of this software are known.
| [CVE-2008-3259] OpenSSH before 5.1 sets the SO_REUSEADDR socket option when the X11UseLocalhost configuration setting is disabled, which allows local users on some platforms to hijack the X11 forwarding port via a bind to a single IP address, as demonstrated on the HP-UX platform.
| [CVE-2006-0883] OpenSSH on FreeBSD 5.3 and 5.4, when used with OpenPAM, does not properly handle when a forked child process terminates during PAM authentication, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (client connection refusal) by connecting multiple times to the SSH server, waiting for the password prompt, then disconnecting.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2009-2958] The tftp_request function in tftp.c in dnsmasq before 2.50, when --enable-tftp is used, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a TFTP read (aka RRQ) request with a malformed blksize option.
| [CVE-2009-2957] Heap-based buffer overflow in the tftp_request function in tftp.c in dnsmasq before 2.50, when --enable-tftp is used, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long filename in a TFTP packet, as demonstrated by a read (aka RRQ) request.
| [CVE-2013-0198] Dnsmasq before 2.66test2, when used with certain libvirt configurations, replies to queries from prohibited interfaces, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) via spoofed TCP based DNS queries.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-3411.
| [CVE-2012-3411] Dnsmasq before 2.63test1, when used with certain libvirt configurations, replies to requests from prohibited interfaces, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) via a spoofed DNS query.
| [CVE-2008-3350] dnsmasq 2.43 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by (1) sending a DHCPINFORM while lacking a DHCP lease, or (2) attempting to renew a nonexistent DHCP lease for an invalid subnet as an "unknown client," a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-3214.
| [CVE-2008-3214] dnsmasq 2.25 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by (1) renewing a nonexistent lease or (2) sending a DHCPREQUEST for an IP address that is not in the same network, related to the DHCP NAK response from the daemon.
| [CVE-2006-2017] Dnsmasq 2.29 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a DHCP client broadcast reply request.
| [CVE-2005-0877] Dnsmasq before 2.21 allows remote attackers to poison the DNS cache via answers to queries that were not made by Dnsmasq.
| [CVE-2005-0876] Off-by-one buffer overflow in Dnsmasq before 2.21 may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via the DHCP lease file.
