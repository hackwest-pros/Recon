| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-1999-0661] A system is running a version of software that was replaced with a Trojan Horse at one of its distribution points, such as (1) TCP Wrappers 7.6, (2) util-linux 2.9g, (3) wuarchive ftpd (wuftpd) 2.2 and 2.1f, (4) IRC client (ircII) ircII 2.2.9, (5) OpenSSH 3.4p1, or (6) Sendmail 8.12.6.
| [CVE-2010-4755] The (1) remote_glob function in sftp-glob.c and the (2) process_put function in sftp.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, as used in FreeBSD 7.3 and 8.1, NetBSD 5.0.2, OpenBSD 4.7, and other products, allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any pathnames, as demonstrated by glob expressions in SSH_FXP_STAT requests to an sftp daemon, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2012-2532] Microsoft FTP Service 7.0 and 7.5 for Internet Information Services (IIS) processes unspecified commands before TLS is enabled for a session, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading the replies to these commands, aka "FTP Command Injection Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2012-2531] Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.5 uses weak permissions for the Operational log, which allows local users to discover credentials by reading this file, aka "Password Disclosure Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2010-3972] Heap-based buffer overflow in the TELNET_STREAM_CONTEXT::OnSendData function in ftpsvc.dll in Microsoft FTP Service 7.0 and 7.5 for Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0, and IIS 7.5, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted FTP command, aka "IIS FTP Service Heap Buffer Overrun Vulnerability." NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
| [CVE-2010-2730] Buffer overflow in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.5, when FastCGI is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted headers in a request, aka "Request Header Buffer Overflow Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2010-1899] Stack consumption vulnerability in the ASP implementation in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.1, 6.0, 7.0, and 7.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon outage) via a crafted request, related to asp.dll, aka "IIS Repeated Parameter Request Denial of Service Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2010-1256] Unspecified vulnerability in Microsoft IIS 6.0, 7.0, and 7.5, when Extended Protection for Authentication is enabled, allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors related to "token checking" that trigger memory corruption, aka "IIS Authentication Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2013-0941] EMC RSA Authentication API before 8.1 SP1, RSA Web Agent before 5.3.5 for Apache Web Server, RSA Web Agent before 5.3.5 for IIS, RSA PAM Agent before 7.0, and RSA Agent before 6.1.4 for Microsoft Windows use an improper encryption algorithm and a weak key for maintaining the stored data of the node secret for the SecurID Authentication API, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information via cryptographic attacks on this data.
| [CVE-2010-3229] The Secure Channel (aka SChannel) security package in Microsoft Windows Vista SP1 and SP2, Windows Server 2008 Gold, SP2, and R2, and Windows 7, when IIS 7.x is used, does not properly process client certificates during SSL and TLS handshakes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (LSASS outage and reboot) via a crafted packet, aka "TLSv1 Denial of Service Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2010-1886] Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP1 and SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2, and Windows 7 allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging access to a process with NetworkService credentials, as demonstrated by TAPI Server, SQL Server, and IIS processes, and related to the Windows Service Isolation feature.  NOTE: the vendor states that privilege escalation from NetworkService to LocalSystem does not cross a "security boundary."
| [CVE-2009-3555] The TLS protocol, and the SSL protocol 3.0 and possibly earlier, as used in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0, mod_ssl in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.14 and earlier, OpenSSL before 0.9.8l, GnuTLS 2.8.5 and earlier, Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) 3.12.4 and earlier, multiple Cisco products, and other products, does not properly associate renegotiation handshakes with an existing connection, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert data into HTTPS sessions, and possibly other types of sessions protected by TLS or SSL, by sending an unauthenticated request that is processed retroactively by a server in a post-renegotiation context, related to a "plaintext injection" attack, aka the "Project Mogul" issue.
| [CVE-2009-2521] Stack consumption vulnerability in the FTP Service in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 through 7.0 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a list (ls) -R command containing a wildcard that references a subdirectory, followed by a .. (dot dot), aka "IIS FTP Service DoS Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2009-1536] ASP.NET in Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 SP1 and SP2 and 3.5 Gold and SP1, when ASP 2.0 is used in integrated mode on IIS 7.0, does not properly manage request scheduling, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon outage) via a series of crafted HTTP requests, aka "Remote Unauthenticated Denial of Service in ASP.NET Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2008-1446] Integer overflow in the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) ISAPI extension in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 through 7.0 on Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, Server 2003 SP1 and SP2, and Server 2008 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via an HTTP POST request that triggers an outbound IPP connection from a web server to a machine operated by the attacker, aka "Integer Overflow in IPP Service Vulnerability."
| [CVE-2008-0074] Unspecified vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 through 7.0 allows local users to gain privileges via unknown vectors related to file change notifications in the TPRoot, NNTPFile\Root, or WWWRoot folders.
| [CVE-2007-2931] Heap-based buffer overflow in Microsoft MSN Messenger 6.2, 7.0, and 7.5, and Live Messenger 8.0 allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors involving video conversation handling in Web Cam and video chat sessions.
| [CVE-2007-1278] Unspecified vulnerability in the IIS connector in Adobe JRun 4.0 Updater 6, and ColdFusion MX 6.1 and 7.0 Enterprise, when using Microsoft IIS 6, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors, involving the request of a file in the JRun web root.
| [CVE-2006-5858] Adobe ColdFusion MX 7 through 7.0.2, and JRun 4, when run on Microsoft IIS, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, list directories, or read source code via a double URL-encoded NULL byte in a ColdFusion filename, such as a CFM file.
| [CVE-2006-5028] Directory traversal vulnerability in filemanager/filemanager.php in SWsoft Plesk 7.5 Reload and Plesk 7.6 for Microsoft Windows allows remote attackers to list arbitrary directories via a ../ (dot dot slash) in the file parameter in a chdir action.
| [CVE-2006-0363] The "Remember my Password" feature in MSN Messenger 7.5 stores passwords in an encrypted format under the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\IdentityCRL\Creds registry key, which might allow local users to obtain the original passwords via a program that calls CryptUnprotectData, as demonstrated by the "MSN Password Recovery.exe" program.  NOTE: it could be argued that local-only password recovery is inherently insecure because the decryption methods and keys must be stored somewhere on the local system, and are thus inherently accessible with varying degrees of effort.  Perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.

| [CVE-2000-0596] Internet Explorer 5.x does not warn a user before opening a Microsoft Access database file that is referenced within ActiveX OBJECT tags in an HTML document, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands, aka the "IE Script" vulnerability.
| [CVE-2000-0400] The Microsoft Active Movie ActiveX Control in Internet Explorer 5 does not restrict which file types can be downloaded, which allows an attacker to download any type of file to a user's system by encoding it within an email message or news post.
| [CVE-2000-0302] Microsoft Index Server allows remote attackers to view the source code of ASP files by appending a %20 to the filename in the CiWebHitsFile argument to the null.htw URL.
| [CVE-2000-0168] Microsoft Windows 9x operating systems allow an attacker to cause a denial of service via a pathname that includes file device names, aka the "DOS Device in Path Name" vulnerability.
| [CVE-2000-0162] The Microsoft virtual machine (VM) in Internet Explorer 4.x and 5.x allows a remote attacker to read files via a malicious Java applet that escapes the Java sandbox, aka the "VM File Reading" vulnerability.
| [CVE-2000-0089] The rdisk utility in Microsoft Terminal Server Edition and Windows NT 4.0 stores registry hive information in a temporary file with permissions that allow local users to read it, aka the "RDISK Registry Enumeration File" vulnerability.
| [CVE-1999-1440] Win32 ICQ 98a 1.30, and possibly other versions, does not display the entire portion of long filenames, which could allow attackers to send an executable file with a long name that contains so many spaces that the .exe extension is not displayed, which could make the user believe that the file is safe to open from the client.
| [CVE-1999-1430] PIM software for Royal daVinci does not properly password-protext access to data stored in the .mdb (Microsoft Access) file, which allows local users to read the data without a password by directly accessing the files with a different application, such as Access.
| [CVE-1999-1259] Microsoft Office 98, Macintosh Edition, does not properly initialize the disk space used by Office 98 files and effectively inserts data from previously deleted files into the Office file, which could allow attackers to obtain sensitive information.
| [CVE-1999-0527] The permissions for system-critical data in an anonymous FTP account are inappropriate.  For example, the root directory is writeable by world, a real password file is obtainable, or executable commands such as "ls" can be overwritten.
| [CVE-1999-0386] Microsoft Personal Web Server and FrontPage Personal Web Server in some Windows systems allows a remote attacker to read files on the server by using a nonstandard URL.

| [CVE-2002-0191] Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01, 5.5 and 6.0 allows remote attackers to view arbitrary files that contain the "{" character via script containing the cssText property of the stylesheet object, aka "Local Information Disclosure through HTML Object" vulnerability.
| [CVE-2002-0188] Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 and 6.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via malformed Content-Disposition and Content-Type header fields that cause the application for the spoofed file type to pass the file back to the operating system for handling rather than raise an error message, aka the second variant of the "Content Disposition" vulnerability.
| [CVE-2002-0103] An installer program for Oracle9iAS Web Cache 2.0.0.x creates executable and configuration files with insecure permissions, which allows local users to gain privileges by (1) running webcached or (2) obtaining the administrator password from webcache.xml.
| [CVE-2002-0077] Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01, 5.5 and 6.0 treats objects invoked on an HTML page with the codebase property as part of Local Computer zone, which allows remote attackers to invoke executables present on the local system through objects such as the popup object, aka the "Local Executable Invocation via Object tag" vulnerability.
| [CVE-2002-0057] XMLHTTP control in Microsoft XML Core Services 2.6 and later does not properly handle IE Security Zone settings, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files by specifying a local file as an XML Data Source.
| [CVE-2002-0034] The Microsoft CONVERT.EXE program, when used on Windows 2000 and Windows XP systems, does not apply the default NTFS permissions when converting a FAT32 file system, which could cause the conversion to produce a file system with less secure permissions than expected.
| [CVE-2001-1243] Scripting.FileSystemObject in asp.dll for Microsoft IIS 4.0 and 5.0 allows local or remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via (1) creating an ASP program that uses Scripting.FileSystemObject to open a file with an MS-DOS device name, or (2) remotely injecting the device name into ASP programs that internally use Scripting.FileSystemObject.
| [CVE-2001-0986] SQLQHit.asp sample file in Microsoft Index Server 2.0 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information such as the physical path, file attributes, or portions of source code by directly calling sqlqhit.asp with a CiScope parameter set to (1) webinfo, (2) extended_fileinfo, (3) extended_webinfo, or (4) fileinfo.
| [CVE-2001-0398] The BAT! mail client allows remote attackers to bypass user warnings of an executable attachment and execute arbitrary commands via an attachment whose file name contains many spaces, which also causes the BAT!  to misrepresent the attachment's type with a different icon.
| [CVE-2001-0261] Microsoft Windows 2000 Encrypted File System does not properly destroy backups of files that are encrypted, which allows a local attacker to recover the text of encrypted files.
| [CVE-2001-0004] IIS 5.0 and 4.0 allows remote attackers to read the source code for executable web server programs by appending "%3F+.htr" to the requested URL, which causes the files to be parsed by the .HTR ISAPI extension, aka a variant of the "File Fragment Reading via .HTR" vulnerability.
| [CVE-2000-0886] IIS 5.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a malformed request for an executable file whose name is appended with operating system commands, aka the "Web Server File Request Parsing" vulnerability.
| [CVE-2000-0790] The web-based folder display capability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 on Windows 98 allows local users to insert Trojan horse programs by modifying the Folder.htt file and using the InvokeVerb method in the ShellDefView ActiveX control to specify a default execute option for the first file that is listed in the folder.
| [CVE-2000-0756] Microsoft Outlook 2000 does not properly process long or malformed fields in vCard (.vcf) files, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service.
| [CVE-2000-0596] Internet Explorer 5.x does not warn a user before opening a Microsoft Access database file that is referenced within ActiveX OBJECT tags in an HTML document, which could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands, aka the "IE Script" vulnerability.
| [CVE-2000-0400] The Microsoft Active Movie ActiveX Control in Internet Explorer 5 does not restrict which file types can be downloaded, which allows an attacker to download any type of file to a user's system by encoding it within an email message or news post.
| [CVE-2000-0302] Microsoft Index Server allows remote attackers to view the source code of ASP files by appending a %20 to the filename in the CiWebHitsFile argument to the null.htw URL.
