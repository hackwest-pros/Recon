| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2012-5975] The SSH USERAUTH CHANGE REQUEST feature in SSH Tectia Server 6.0.4 through 6.0.20, 6.1.0 through 6.1.12, 6.2.0 through 6.2.5, and 6.3.0 through 6.3.2 on UNIX and Linux, when old-style password authentication is enabled, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted session involving entry of blank passwords, as demonstrated by a root login session from a modified OpenSSH client with an added input_userauth_passwd_changereq call in sshconnect2.c.
| [CVE-2012-5536] A certain Red Hat build of the pam_ssh_agent_auth module on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 and Fedora Rawhide calls the glibc error function instead of the error function in the OpenSSH codebase, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from process memory or possibly gain privileges via crafted use of an application that relies on this module, as demonstrated by su and sudo.
| [CVE-2010-5107] The default configuration of OpenSSH through 6.1 enforces a fixed time limit between establishing a TCP connection and completing a login, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connection-slot exhaustion) by periodically making many new TCP connections.
| [CVE-2008-1483] OpenSSH 4.3p2, and probably other versions, allows local users to hijack forwarded X connections by causing ssh to set DISPLAY to :10, even when another process is listening on the associated port, as demonstrated by opening TCP port 6010 (IPv4) and sniffing a cookie sent by Emacs.
| [CVE-2007-3102] Unspecified vulnerability in the linux_audit_record_event function in OpenSSH 4.3p2, as used on Fedora Core 6 and possibly other systems, allows remote attackers to write arbitrary characters to an audit log via a crafted username.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
| [CVE-2004-2414] Novell NetWare 6.5 SP 1.1, when installing or upgrading using the Overlay CDs and performing a custom installation with OpenSSH, includes sensitive password information in the (1) NIOUTPUT.TXT and (2) NI.LOG log files, which might allow local users to obtain the passwords.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2011-4862] Buffer overflow in libtelnet/encrypt.c in telnetd in FreeBSD 7.3 through 9.0, MIT Kerberos Version 5 Applications (aka krb5-appl) 1.0.2 and earlier, Heimdal 1.5.1 and earlier, GNU inetutils, and possibly other products allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long encryption key, as exploited in the wild in December 2011.
| [CVE-2011-2716] The DHCP client (udhcpc) in BusyBox before 1.20.0 allows remote DHCP servers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the (1) HOST_NAME, (2) DOMAIN_NAME, (3) NIS_DOMAIN, and (4) TFTP_SERVER_NAME host name options.
| [CVE-2010-4965] /etc/rc.d/rc.local on the D-Link DCS-2121 camera with firmware 1.04 configures a hardcoded password of admin for the root account, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain shell access by leveraging a running telnetd server.
| [CVE-2009-0641] sys_term.c in telnetd in FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE and other 7.x versions deletes dangerous environment variables with a method that was valid only in older FreeBSD distributions, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by passing a crafted environment variable from a telnet client, as demonstrated by an LD_PRELOAD value that references a malicious library.
| [CVE-2008-0153] telnetd.exe in Pragma TelnetServer 7.0.4.589 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process crash and resource exhaustion) via a crafted TELOPT PRAGMA LOGON telnet option, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference.
| [CVE-2007-0956] The telnet daemon (telnetd) in MIT krb5 before 1.6.1 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain system access via a username beginning with a '-' character, a similar issue to CVE-2007-0882.
| [CVE-2007-0882] Argument injection vulnerability in the telnet daemon (in.telnetd) in Solaris 10 and 11 (SunOS 5.10 and 5.11) misinterprets certain client "-f" sequences as valid requests for the login program to skip authentication, which allows remote attackers to log into certain accounts, as demonstrated by the bin account.
| [CVE-2006-5050] Directory traversal vulnerability in httpd in Rob Landley BusyBox allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via URL-encoded "%2e%2e/" sequences in the URI.
| [CVE-2006-1058] BusyBox 1.1.1 does not use a salt when generating passwords, which makes it easier for local users to guess passwords from a stolen password file using techniques such as rainbow tables.
| [CVE-2006-0677] telnetd in Heimdal 0.6.x before 0.6.6 and 0.7.x before 0.7.2 allows remote unauthenticated attackers to cause a denial of service (server crash) via unknown vectors that trigger a null dereference.
| [CVE-2005-2136] Raritan Dominion SX (DSX) Console Servers DSX16, DSX32, DSX4, DSX8, and DSXA-48 set (1) world-readable permissions for /etc/shadow and (2) world-writable permissions for /bin/busybox, which allows local users to obtain hashed passwords or execute arbitrary code as other users.
| [CVE-2005-2040] Multiple buffer overflows in the getterminaltype function in telnetd for Heimdal before 0.6.5 may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-0468 and CVE-2005-0469.
| [CVE-2004-0998] Format string vulnerability in telnetd-ssl 0.17 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
| [CVE-2004-0911] telnetd for netkit 0.17 and earlier, and possibly other versions, on Debian GNU/Linux allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (free of an invalid pointer), a different vulnerability than CVE-2001-0554.
| [CVE-2004-0640] Format string vulnerability in the SSL_set_verify function in telnetd.c for SSLtelnet daemon (SSLtelnetd) 0.13 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
| [CVE-2003-1069] The Telnet daemon (in.telnetd) for Solaris 2.6 through 9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption by infinite loop).
| [CVE-2001-1340] Beck GmbH IPC@Chip TelnetD service supports only one connection and does not disconnect a user who does not complete the login process, which allows remote attackers to lock out the administrator account by connecting to the service.
| [CVE-2001-1338] Beck IPC GmbH IPC@CHIP TelnetD server generates different responses when given valid and invalid login names, which allows remote attackers to determine accounts on the system.
| [CVE-2001-0554] Buffer overflow in BSD-based telnetd telnet daemon on various operating systems allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a set of options including AYT (Are You There), which is not properly handled by the telrcv function.
| [CVE-2001-0094] Buffer overflow in kdc_reply_cipher of libkrb (Kerberos 4 authentication library) in NetBSD 1.5 and FreeBSD 4.2 and earlier, as used in Kerberised applications such as telnetd and login, allows local users to gain root privileges.
| [CVE-2001-0093] Vulnerability in telnetd in FreeBSD 1.5 allows local users to gain root privileges by modifying critical environmental variables that affect the behavior of telnetd.
| [CVE-2000-1195] telnet daemon (telnetd) from the Linux netkit package before netkit-telnet-0.16 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication when telnetd is running with the -L command line option.
| [CVE-2000-1184] telnetd in FreeBSD 4.2 and earlier, and possibly other operating systems, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by specifying an arbitrary large file in the TERMCAP environmental variable, which consumes resources as the server processes the file.
| [CVE-2000-0733] Telnetd telnet server in IRIX 5.2 through 6.1 does not properly cleans user-injected format strings, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a long RLD variable in the IAC-SB-TELOPT_ENVIRON request.
| [CVE-2000-0166] Buffer overflow in the InterAccess telnet server TelnetD allows remote attackers to execute commands via a long login name.
| [CVE-1999-1211] Vulnerability in in.telnetd in SunOS 4.1.1 and earlier allows local users to gain root privileges.
| [CVE-1999-0740] Remote attackers can cause a denial of service on Linux in.telnetd telnet daemon through a malformed TERM environmental variable.

| [CVE-2003-0249] ** DISPUTED **  PHP treats unknown methods such as "PoSt" as a GET request, which could allow attackers to intended access restrictions if PHP is running on a server that passes on all methods, such as Apache httpd 2.0, as demonstrated using a Limit directive.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the Apache security team, saying "It is by design that PHP allows scripts to process any request method.  A script which does not explicitly verify the request method will hence be processed as normal for arbitrary methods.  It is therefore expected behaviour that one cannot implement per-method access control using the Apache configuration alone, which is the assumption made in this report."

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2013-4124] Integer overflow in the read_nttrans_ea_list function in nttrans.c in smbd in Samba 3.x before 3.5.22, 3.6.x before 3.6.17, and 4.x before 4.0.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a malformed packet.
| [CVE-2011-0719] Samba 3.x before 3.3.15, 3.4.x before 3.4.12, and 3.5.x before 3.5.7 does not perform range checks for file descriptors before use of the FD_SET macro, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption, and infinite loop or daemon crash) by opening a large number of files, related to (1) Winbind or (2) smbd.
| [CVE-2013-0214] Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.21, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, and 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users by leveraging knowledge of a password and composing requests that perform SWAT actions.
| [CVE-2013-0213] The Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.21, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, and 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks via a (1) FRAME or (2) IFRAME element.
| [CVE-2012-1182] The RPC code generator in Samba 3.x before 3.4.16, 3.5.x before 3.5.14, and 3.6.x before 3.6.4 does not implement validation of an array length in a manner consistent with validation of array memory allocation, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted RPC call.
| [CVE-2011-2694] Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the chg_passwd function in web/swat.c in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.10 allows remote authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the username parameter to the passwd program (aka the user field to the Change Password page).
| [CVE-2011-2522] Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.10 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) shut down daemons, (2) start daemons, (3) add shares, (4) remove shares, (5) add printers, (6) remove printers, (7) add user accounts, or (8) remove user accounts, as demonstrated by certain start, stop, and restart parameters to the status program.
| [CVE-2004-0186] smbmnt in Samba 2.x and 3.x on Linux 2.6, when installed setuid, allows local users to gain root privileges by mounting a Samba share that contains a setuid root program, whose setuid attributes are not cleared when the share is mounted.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2013-4124] Integer overflow in the read_nttrans_ea_list function in nttrans.c in smbd in Samba 3.x before 3.5.22, 3.6.x before 3.6.17, and 4.x before 4.0.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a malformed packet.
| [CVE-2011-0719] Samba 3.x before 3.3.15, 3.4.x before 3.4.12, and 3.5.x before 3.5.7 does not perform range checks for file descriptors before use of the FD_SET macro, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption, and infinite loop or daemon crash) by opening a large number of files, related to (1) Winbind or (2) smbd.
| [CVE-2013-0214] Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.21, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, and 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users by leveraging knowledge of a password and composing requests that perform SWAT actions.
| [CVE-2013-0213] The Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.21, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, and 4.x before 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks via a (1) FRAME or (2) IFRAME element.
| [CVE-2012-1182] The RPC code generator in Samba 3.x before 3.4.16, 3.5.x before 3.5.14, and 3.6.x before 3.6.4 does not implement validation of an array length in a manner consistent with validation of array memory allocation, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted RPC call.
| [CVE-2011-2694] Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the chg_passwd function in web/swat.c in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.10 allows remote authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the username parameter to the passwd program (aka the user field to the Change Password page).
| [CVE-2011-2522] Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) in Samba 3.x before 3.5.10 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) shut down daemons, (2) start daemons, (3) add shares, (4) remove shares, (5) add printers, (6) remove printers, (7) add user accounts, or (8) remove user accounts, as demonstrated by certain start, stop, and restart parameters to the status program.
| [CVE-2004-0186] smbmnt in Samba 2.x and 3.x on Linux 2.6, when installed setuid, allows local users to gain root privileges by mounting a Samba share that contains a setuid root program, whose setuid attributes are not cleared when the share is mounted.

| MITRE CVE - http://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2013-4156] Apache OpenOffice.org (OOo) before 4.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted element in an OOXML document file.
| [CVE-2013-4131] The mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module in Subversion 1.7.0 through 1.7.10 and 1.8.x before 1.8.1 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (assertion failure or out-of-bounds read) via a certain (1) COPY, (2) DELETE, or (3) MOVE request against a revision root.
| [CVE-2013-3239] phpMyAdmin 3.5.x before 3.5.8 and 4.x before 4.0.0-rc3, when a SaveDir directory is configured, allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by using a double extension in the filename of an export file, leading to interpretation of this file as an executable file by the Apache HTTP Server, as demonstrated by a .php.sql filename.
| [CVE-2013-3060] The web console in Apache ActiveMQ before 5.8.0 does not require authentication, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service via HTTP requests.
| [CVE-2013-2765] The ModSecurity module before 2.7.4 for the Apache HTTP Server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference, process crash, and disk consumption) via a POST request with a large body and a crafted Content-Type header.
| [CVE-2013-2251] Apache Struts 2.0.0 through 2.3.15 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OGNL expressions via a parameter with a crafted (1) action:, (2) redirect:, or (3) redirectAction: prefix.
| [CVE-2013-2249] mod_session_dbd.c in the mod_session_dbd module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.5 proceeds with save operations for a session without considering the dirty flag and the requirement for a new session ID, which has unspecified impact and remote attack vectors.
| [CVE-2013-2248] Multiple open redirect vulnerabilities in Apache Struts 2.0.0 through 2.3.15 allow remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via a URL in a parameter using the (1) redirect: or (2) redirectAction: prefix.
| [CVE-2013-2189] Apache OpenOffice.org (OOo) before 4.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via invalid PLCF data in a DOC document file.
| [CVE-2013-2135] Apache Struts 2 before 2.3.14.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OGNL code via a request with a crafted value that contains both "${}" and "%{}" sequences, which causes the OGNL code to be evaluated twice.
| [CVE-2013-2134] Apache Struts 2 before 2.3.14.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OGNL code via a request with a crafted action name that is not properly handled during wildcard matching, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-2135.
| [CVE-2013-2115] Apache Struts 2 before 2.3.14.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OGNL code via a crafted request that is not properly handled when using the includeParams attribute in the (1) URL or (2) A tag. NOTE: this issue is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-1966.
| [CVE-2013-2071] java/org/apache/catalina/core/AsyncContextImpl.java in Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.40 does not properly handle the throwing of a RuntimeException in an AsyncListener in an application, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive request information intended for other applications in opportunistic circumstances via an application that records the requests that it processes.
| [CVE-2013-2067] java/org/apache/catalina/authenticator/FormAuthenticator.java in the form authentication feature in Apache Tomcat 6.0.21 through 6.0.36 and 7.x before 7.0.33 does not properly handle the relationships between authentication requirements and sessions, which allows remote attackers to inject a request into a session by sending this request during completion of the login form, a variant of a session fixation attack.
| [CVE-2013-1966] Apache Struts 2 before 2.3.14.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OGNL code via a crafted request that is not properly handled when using the includeParams attribute in the (1) URL or (2) A tag.
| [CVE-2013-1965] Apache Struts Showcase App 2.0.0 through 2.3.13, as used in Struts 2 before 2.3.14.1, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OGNL code via a crafted parameter name that is not properly handled when invoking a redirect.
| [CVE-2013-1896] mod_dav.c in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.25 does not properly determine whether DAV is enabled for a URI, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a MERGE request in which the URI is configured for handling by the mod_dav_svn module, but a certain href attribute in XML data refers to a non-DAV URI.
| [CVE-2013-1884] The mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module in Subversion 1.7.0 through 1.7.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault and crash) via a log REPORT request with an invalid limit, which triggers an access of an uninitialized variable.
| [CVE-2013-1879] Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in scheduled.jsp in Apache ActiveMQ 5.8.0 and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving the "cron of a message."
| [CVE-2013-1862] mod_rewrite.c in the mod_rewrite module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.25 writes data to a log file without sanitizing non-printable characters, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via an HTTP request containing an escape sequence for a terminal emulator.
| [CVE-2013-1849] The mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module in Subversion 1.6.x through 1.6.20 and 1.7.0 through 1.7.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) via a PROPFIND request for an activity URL.
| [CVE-2013-1847] The mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module in Subversion 1.6.0 through 1.6.20 and 1.7.0 through 1.7.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) via an anonymous LOCK for a URL that does not exist.
| [CVE-2013-1846] The mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module in Subversion 1.6.x before 1.6.21 and 1.7.0 through 1.7.8 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) via a LOCK on an activity URL.
| [CVE-2013-1845] The mod_dav_svn Apache HTTPD server module in Subversion 1.6.x before 1.6.21 and 1.7.0 through 1.7.8 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by (1) setting or (2) deleting a large number of properties for a file or directory.
| [CVE-2013-1814] The users/get program in the User RPC API in Apache Rave 0.11 through 0.20 allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information about all user accounts via the offset parameter, as demonstrated by discovering password hashes in the password field of a response.
| [CVE-2013-1777] The JMX Remoting functionality in Apache Geronimo 3.x before 3.0.1, as used in IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) Community Edition 3.0.0.3 and other products, does not property implement the RMI classloader, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by using the JMX connector to send a crafted serialized object.
| [CVE-2013-1768] The BrokerFactory functionality in Apache OpenJPA 1.x before 1.2.3 and 2.x before 2.2.2 creates local executable JSP files containing logging trace data produced during deserialization of certain crafted OpenJPA objects, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by creating a serialized object and leveraging improperly secured server programs.
| [CVE-2013-1088] Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Novell iManager 2.7 before SP6 Patch 1 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users by leveraging improper request validation by iManager code deployed within an Apache Tomcat container.
| [CVE-2013-1048] The Debian apache2ctl script in the apache2 package squeeze before 2.2.16-6+squeeze11, wheezy before 2.2.22-13, and sid before 2.2.22-13 for the Apache HTTP Server on Debian GNU/Linux does not properly create the /var/lock/apache2 lock directory, which allows local users to gain privileges via an unspecified symlink attack.
| [CVE-2013-0966] The Apple mod_hfs_apple module for the Apache HTTP Server in Apple Mac OS X before 10.8.3 does not properly handle ignorable Unicode characters, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended directory authentication requirements via a crafted pathname in a URI.
| [CVE-2013-0942] Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in EMC RSA Authentication Agent 7.1 before 7.1.1 for Web for Internet Information Services, and 7.1 before 7.1.1 for Web for Apache, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.
| [CVE-2013-0941] EMC RSA Authentication API before 8.1 SP1, RSA Web Agent before 5.3.5 for Apache Web Server, RSA Web Agent before 5.3.5 for IIS, RSA PAM Agent before 7.0, and RSA Agent before 6.1.4 for Microsoft Windows use an improper encryption algorithm and a weak key for maintaining the stored data of the node secret for the SecurID Authentication API, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information via cryptographic attacks on this data.
| [CVE-2013-0253] The default configuration of Apache Maven 3.0.4, when using Maven Wagon 2.1, disables SSL certificate checks, which allows remote attackers to spoof servers via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
| [CVE-2013-0248] The default configuration of javax.servlet.context.tempdir in Apache Commons FileUpload 1.0 through 1.2.2 uses the /tmp directory for uploaded files, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via an unspecified symlink attack.
| [CVE-2013-0239] Apache CXF before 2.5.9, 2.6.x before 2.6.6, and 2.7.x before 2.7.3, when the plaintext UsernameToken WS-SecurityPolicy is enabled, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a security header of a SOAP request containing a UsernameToken element that lacks a password child element.
| [CVE-2012-6573] Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Apache Solr Autocomplete module 6.x-1.x before 6.x-1.4 and 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.3 for Drupal allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving autocomplete results.
| [CVE-2012-6551] The default configuration of Apache ActiveMQ before 5.8.0 enables a sample web application, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (broker resource consumption) via HTTP requests.
| [CVE-2012-6092] Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the web demos in Apache ActiveMQ before 5.8.0 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the refresh parameter to PortfolioPublishServlet.java (aka demo/portfolioPublish or Market Data Publisher), or vectors involving (2) debug logs or (3) subscribe messages in webapp/websocket/chat.js.  NOTE: AMQ-4124 is covered by CVE-2012-6551.
| [CVE-2012-5887] The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.36, 6.x before 6.0.36, and 7.x before 7.0.30 does not properly check for stale nonce values in conjunction with enforcement of proper credentials, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by sniffing the network for valid requests.
| [CVE-2012-5886] The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.36, 6.x before 6.0.36, and 7.x before 7.0.30 caches information about the authenticated user within the session state, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass authentication via vectors related to the session ID.
| [CVE-2012-5885] The replay-countermeasure functionality in the HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.36, 6.x before 6.0.36, and 7.x before 7.0.30 tracks cnonce (aka client nonce) values instead of nonce (aka server nonce) and nc (aka nonce-count) values, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by sniffing the network for valid requests, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1184.

| [CVE-2003-0249] ** DISPUTED **  PHP treats unknown methods such as "PoSt" as a GET request, which could allow attackers to intended access restrictions if PHP is running on a server that passes on all methods, such as Apache httpd 2.0, as demonstrated using a Limit directive.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the Apache security team, saying "It is by design that PHP allows scripts to process any request method.  A script which does not explicitly verify the request method will hence be processed as normal for arbitrary methods.  It is therefore expected behaviour that one cannot implement per-method access control using the Apache configuration alone, which is the assumption made in this report."

NOTE: the printenv issue might still exist for web browsers that can render text/plain content types as HTML, such as Internet Explorer, but CVE regards this as a design limitation of those browsers, not Apache.  The printenv.pl/acuparam vector, discloser on 20070724, is one such variant.
| [CVE-2000-1204] Vulnerability in the mod_vhost_alias virtual hosting module for Apache 1.3.9, 1.3.11 and 1.3.12 allows remote attackers to obtain the source code for CGI programs if the cgi-bin directory is under the document root.
| [CVE-2000-1168] IBM HTTP Server 1.3.6 (based on Apache) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary commands via a long GET request.
| [CVE-2000-1016] The default configuration of Apache (httpd.conf) on SuSE 6.4 includes an alias for the /usr/doc directory, which allows remote attackers to read package documentation and obtain system configuration information via an HTTP request for the /doc/packages URL.
| [CVE-2000-0913] mod_rewrite in Apache 1.3.12 and earlier allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files if a RewriteRule directive is expanded to include a filename whose name contains a regular expression.
| [CVE-2000-0883] The default configuration of mod_perl for Apache as installed on Mandrake Linux 6.1 through 7.1 sets the /perl/ directory to be browseable, which allows remote attackers to list the contents of that directory.
| [CVE-2000-0869] The default configuration of Apache 1.3.12 in SuSE Linux 6.4 enables WebDAV, which allows remote attackers to list arbitrary diretories via the PROPFIND HTTP request method.
| [CVE-2000-0868] The default configuration of Apache 1.3.12 in SuSE Linux 6.4 allows remote attackers to read source code for CGI scripts by replacing the /cgi-bin/ in the requested URL with /cgi-bin-sdb/.
| [CVE-2000-0791] Trustix installs the httpsd program for Apache-SSL with world-writeable permissions, which allows local users to replace it with a Trojan horse.
| [CVE-2000-0760] The Snoop servlet in Jakarta Tomcat 3.1 and 3.0 under Apache reveals sensitive system information when a remote attacker requests a nonexistent URL with a .snp extension.
| [CVE-2000-0759] Jakarta Tomcat 3.1 under Apache reveals physical path information when a remote attacker requests a URL that does not exist, which generates an error message that includes the physical path.
| [CVE-2000-0628] The source.asp example script in the Apache ASP module Apache::ASP 1.93 and earlier allows remote attackers to modify files.
| [CVE-2000-0505] The Apache 1.3.x HTTP server for Windows platforms allows remote attackers to list directory contents by requesting a URL containing a large number of / characters.
| [CVE-1999-1412] A possible interaction between Apple MacOS X release 1.0 and Apache HTTP server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a flood of HTTP GET requests to CGI programs, which generates a large number of processes.
| [CVE-1999-1293] mod_proxy in Apache 1.2.5 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via malformed FTP commands, which causes Apache to dump core.
| [CVE-1999-1237] Multiple buffer overflows in smbvalid/smbval SMB authentication library, as used in Apache::AuthenSmb and possibly other modules, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via (1) a long username, (2) a long password, and (3) other unspecified methods.
| [CVE-1999-1199] Apache WWW server 1.3.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion) via a large number of MIME headers with the same name, aka the "sioux" vulnerability.
| [CVE-1999-1053] guestbook.pl cleanses user-inserted SSI commands by removing text between "<!--" and "-->" separators, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands when guestbook.pl is run on Apache 1.3.9 and possibly other versions, since Apache allows other closing sequences besides "-->".
| [CVE-1999-0926] Apache allows remote attackers to conduct a denial of service via a large number of MIME headers.
| [CVE-1999-0678] A default configuration of Apache on Debian GNU/Linux sets the ServerRoot to /usr/doc, which allows remote users to read documentation files for the entire server.
| [CVE-1999-0448] IIS 4.0 and Apache log HTTP request methods, regardless of how long they are, allowing a remote attacker to hide the URL they really request.
| [CVE-1999-0289] The Apache web server for Win32 may provide access to restricted files when a . (dot) is appended to a requested URL.
| [CVE-1999-0236] ScriptAlias directory in NCSA and Apache httpd allowed attackers to read CGI programs.
| [CVE-1999-0107] Buffer overflow in Apache 1.2.5 and earlier allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service with a large number of GET requests containing a large number of / characters.
| [CVE-1999-0071] Apache httpd cookie buffer overflow for versions 1.1.1 and earlier.
